Just heard that the Moodle stand at BETT has been featured in the show&#8217;s official review, see <http://www.frederation.com/bettreview2006/moodle.php>

> &#8220;Moodle was one small stand which made a big impact with its Open Source Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). The idea is to take the best aspects of classroom practice and use Moodle as a VLE to transfer that into the home environment.&#8221;
