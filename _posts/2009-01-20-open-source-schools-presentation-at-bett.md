The Open Source Schools presentation at BETT on Saturday 17th January was very well received, with good numbers joining the team in Olympia&#8217;s Club Room, despite the early start. I introduced the presentation, outlining what open source means as well as exploring some of the advantages which it offers to schools; I also spoke about Moodle (much to [Ian Usher&#8217;s surprise](http://twitter.com/iusher/status/1125972354)) and the Open Source Schools community. Michelle Walters talked about Open Office and some of the ways which teachers could get started with open source. [José Picardo](http://www.boxoftricks.net/) talked about the Audacity audio editor and [Doug Belshaw](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/) discussed some of the many ways in which he&#8217;s using Linux powered netbooks in his school. It was  a great pleasure to work with such wonderful people on this. Audience members took Ubuntu and OpenEducationDisc CDs away with them so they could try open source software out for themselves.

The presentation was filmed in association with [BBC Backstage](http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/) and [Learn4Life](http://www.L4L.co.uk/), with Leon Cych of Learn4Life doing excellent work editing this footage for the Web. Leon&#8217;s also [written about the presentation](http://www.l4l.co.uk/?p=164) over on his site.
