The [St Ives](http://stiveshaslemere.com/) girls are making increasing use of [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) as a source for images for school work, which I&#8217;m delighted to encourage. Not so much of this in my maths lessons yet (although I have things in mind for [patterns](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/patterns/), [symmetry](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/symmetry/) and [tessellations](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/tessellations/)&#8230;), but there&#8217;s been some great use in geography for illustrating work on glaciation, and this last week I&#8217;ve been hugely impressed by the way it&#8217;s being used for English lessons.

They&#8217;re working on persuasive writing and have spent some time looking at the sort of text that finds its way into advertising brochures, so now they&#8217;re having a go at making a small tri-fold brochure for a holiday resort. Of course the emphasis is on the text, but no brochure is going to be complete without a few pictures. In the past we&#8217;d have used Google image search, but this has provided fairly limited choices, usually at poor quality, with occasional worries about inappropriate images slipping through the automatic filtering, and we&#8217;ve usually had to turn a blind eye to IP issues. Now with Flickr, there&#8217;s a whole host of really high quality stuff available via tag searching, much of which is available under [Creative Commons licences](http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/). They&#8217;re thus becoming a lot more discerning about what makes good pictures for their brochures, and eavesdropping some of the conversations suggests that there&#8217;s lots of visual literacy and semiotics being learnt along the way. Because of the way Flickr presents photographs in their contributor&#8217;s stream, there&#8217;s now a far stronger recognition of the _process_ and the _photographer_ rather than just concern with the actual image.Â  I hope that some will be inspired to be more creative in their own photography, and perhaps share a few pics on flickr themselves.

A little bit of googling around this finds [a nice summary post](http://apps.nitle.org/blog/index.php?title=teaching_and_learning_with_flickr&more=1&c=0&tb=0&pb=1) from Liberal Education Today about other uses of Flickr in schools, and another with [a lovely example](http://apps.nitle.org/blog/index.php?title=teaching_art_history_with_flickr&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) of using the annotation and comment tools to teach art history.
