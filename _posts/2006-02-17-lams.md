I must admit, I&#8217;m not quite sure about LAMS.

[LAMS](http://www.lamsfoundation.org/) is an open source, web-based tool for sequencing learning activities &#8211; so does some of the things a VLE does, but the focus is on putting activities and resources into a sequence, and controlling the progress of learners through that.<!--more-->

[<img class="left" style="border: 1px solid #dddddd" src="http://static.flickr.com/19/100764533_cf390e9cc4_m.jpg" alt="Lams branching" width="240" height="180" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mberry/100764533/ "Lams branching")I attended the [workshop](http://www.lkl.ac.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_events&task=view_detail&Itemid=27&agid=28&year=2006&month=02&day=17) in London today, led by Ernie Ghiglione, LAMS&#8217; technical lead, and there was much that really impressed me &#8211; the drag and drop interface for authoring content for a start, but also the way they&#8217;re integrating with a whole host of VLEs, including Moodle, and, I think best of all, the way the still smallish user community are happy to share their &#8216;sequences&#8217; with one another. For the next release, they&#8217;re going to have branching sequences (see picture below), so learners will be directed to one activity or another depending on how they&#8217;ve done on earlier workÂ  &#8211; sounds a bit like one of those independent learning systems, but it also includes a number of communication components that can be dropped into the sequence, and will at some future date allow the parent VLE&#8217;s tools to be used in LAMS sequences.

This sort of thing is on the agenda for the UK schools learning platform functional specification, but I hadn&#8217;t realised until today that Moodle&#8217;s not unusual amongst VLEs in not providing this sort of control of a learner&#8217;s progress through the resources and activities. Given that LAMS will happily integrate into Moodle, this could be one way of Moodle meeting this aspect of the functional specification, I suppose, although Ernie himself said this would be &#8220;probably useless for elementary and high schools&#8221;!

I think my problem with it is that it presents a very behaviourist model of personalised learning, in which resources and activities may well be tailored to the learner&#8217;s own needs (or at least the course designer&#8217;s perception of them&#8230;), but the learner&#8217;s sense of responsibility for their own learning seems diminished. I also can&#8217;t see how the whole chat and forum thing can work out in a sequence which each individual follows at their own pace, although LAMS gets round this by a system of gates, so that learners progress is held at various points, whilst their peers catch up &#8211; which seems bizarre to me, but I suppose makes a warped kind of sense if you think there&#8217;s just this fixed body of knowledge to be learnt. I&#8217;d love to see the thing up and running in practice, as I&#8217;m not yet convinced that it brings a huge amount to the party.
