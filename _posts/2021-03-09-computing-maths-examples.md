Over the years, I've created a number of different examples for how computing might be better integrated into maths education. Here's at attempt at pulling together some of the things I've said, written and made for this.

## Videos

[Data science breakout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9LSIsf_pT0) at CSTA's Future of CS Summit.

[A walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdL8zzlKOvg) of creating a fractions class in Python, to introduce some of the ideas of object oriented programming.

[A presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hIY6JrkbSk), just before the first COVID-19 lockdown, on teaching data skills for all. 

Three old walkthroughs (from 2011!) with a snowflake theme: [Geogebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boS3nzhWvw8), [Inkscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnUH-k8zGbY) and [Scratch 1.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO2BTc7s38I).
