  <em>My post on this from the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/may/16/agile-pedagogy-computer-programming-learning?INTCMP=SRCH">Guardian Teacher Network Blog</a>:</em>

Policy makers, industry and many teachers are eager that pupils should learn more about computing. This includes learning how to write computer programs, but also &#8220;computational thinking&#8221;, a transferable way of solving problems and exploring situations, which has wide applications across and beyond the curriculum. In short, as pupils learn to program computers and the principles of computer science they start to bring the unique insights of algorithms, abstraction and the like to other fields. The same is true for teachers â€“ ideas from computing can dramatically change the way we think about our work, and one of these, agile development, is what I&#8217;d like to explore here.

I&#8217;m presenting on this and other ideas for teaching computing at <a href="http://bit.ly/TCHcomputerC">a Guardian Seminar</a> on 21st June 2012.</em>
