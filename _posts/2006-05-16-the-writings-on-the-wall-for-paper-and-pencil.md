Interviewed by Heather McLean for today&#8217;s Guardian about blogging and wikis in primary schools:

> Blogging has been brought into the classroom at St Ives school in Haslemere, Surrey. Each student in year 6 has their own blog in a secure, walled setting using Elgg software. Deputy head and information systems manager Miles Berry explains: &#8220;We wanted students to learn how to express their views, and it&#8217;s been a success. We also wanted them to develop an acceptance of other&#8217;s contributions, to appreciate others&#8217; perspectives. They are learning and being inspired by each other&#8217;s writing in a far more immediate way than if we just stuck their work on the wall.&#8221;
> 
> Also at St Ives, students in years 5 and 6 are using wikis (web content that anyone has freedom to edit, such as the free encyclopaedia at [www.wikipedia.org](http://www.wikipedia.org/)) to develop collaborative writing skills. Within the school&#8217;s virtual learning environment (based on free, open-source Moodle software) wikis have been incorporated to allow classes to work together on homework assignments.
