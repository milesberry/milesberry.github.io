  A new service for viewing Flickr&#8217;s geotagged photos launched on Thursday, at<a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060612213500/http://www.mylocalguru.com/map?provider=google&z=16&t=satellite&ll=43.771388,11.255515"> mylocalguru.com</a> &#8211; they seem to have found a way of getting a (nearly) complete dataset of the geotagged photos from Flickr, although I&#8217;m not sure how frequently this gets updated. I suspect that this may end up with advertising once it leaves its beta phase, but for the time being it&#8217;s a great way of exploring the collection, or even <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060612213500/http://www.mylocalguru.com/map?provider=google&ll=50,5&z=4&author=mberry">just your own photos</a>. They&#8217;ve also added Atom feeds for maps &#8211; so once you find an area you&#8217;re interested in you can keep track of new flickr photos, or whatever else they add into the service &#8211; here&#8217;s <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060612213500/http://www.mylocalguru.com/query?format=atom_10&ne=51.244725,-0.381775&sw=51.007706,-0.97229&is_xml=1">our local feed displayed in a webpage</a>. They&#8217;re also added a<a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060612213500/http://www.mylocalguru.com/developer_ge_api.jsp">Google Earth layer</a> via a network link.

  I&#8217;ve now discovered an interesting way of adding geocodes into the exif data via a GPS device &#8211; if the camera&#8217;s clock is in sync with the clock on the GPS receiver, then there are clever little programs which will compare the tracklog from the GPS device with each photo&#8217;s timestamp and add the relevant data into the exif headers for each picture. There&#8217;s <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060612213500/http://wwmx.org/Help.aspx">an explanation</a>and <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060612213500/http://wwmx.org/Download.aspx">some tools</a> from Microsoft Research for this, who&#8217;d thought this through back in 2003!

  I also spent a couple of lessons on Friday introducing Year 4 to Google Earth, which really seemed to capture their imagination, and I know a number were going to be trying it out at home too. We had fun just looking at some of the highlights included in the sightseeing tour as a way fo getting used to the navigation system, managed to find Haslemere station and the school, and then they had a go at adding a few placemarkers to places of personal significance, so we had their homes, former schools, grandparents&#8217; houses and holiday destinations &#8211; the latter was quite interesting as some of them found it quite a challenge to locate their resort or hotel within the country they&#8217;d visited. Clare often start the autumn term with her Year 3s by finding holiday destinations on the classroom map and linking them to postcards &#8211; I love the idea of doing all this via Flickr and Google Earth with real holiday snaps.
