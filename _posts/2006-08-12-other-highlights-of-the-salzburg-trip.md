  The weather, it should be admitted, wasn&#8217;t as kind as we&#8217;d hoped it would be, although I&#8217;m told this is not unusual for Salzburg &#8211; we were amused to see a book titled &#8220;Salzburg Regnet&#8221; and the local science museum had an exhibition of thunder and lightning photos. This meant that we didn&#8217;t get out of the city nearly as much as we&#8217;d planned to, although we still managed a wonderful afternoon and evening down on Lake Fuschl, and a day out over to Lake Wolfgang, and to the top of the Schafberg, from which amazing views over the whole area. Much fun with our new Ixus 800&#8217;s stitch assist function, so some wide panoramas from the mountain top there (see if you can spot the identical twins&#8230;). Although I&#8217;m not a Microsoft fan by any stretch of the imagination, the upcoming <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://labs.live.com/photosynth/default.html">photosynth</a> stuff looks very cool, and I&#8217;d love to try this out.

  We did get to a handful more music events outside the festival proper, including a packed mass at the Peterskirche to Mozart&#8217;s Missa Brevis, a rather lovely chamber recital of some of Mozart&#8217;s early quarters in the splendid acoustic of the Neue Residenz state rooms, given by the local<a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.mozartquartett.at/home.html">Mozart Quartett</a>, and a performance of the Great C Minor mass in the cathedral, given by the Tokyo Oratorio Society, who appeared to have all flown over especially.

<p style="color: #495865;">
  Being in Salzburg was treat enough, and we much enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere (if not necessarily the rain) in the old town. Although the<a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.museumdermoderne.at/">Modern Art gallery</a> building, sat in a prime position overlooking the old town from the top of the Monchsberg, is something of an eye-sore, the temporary exhibition of art with theatrical connections is, for the most part, well worth seeing, more so for Craig and Appia set designs (esp the latter&#8217;s Wagner sets) from the early 20th century, than some of the more, er, experimental stuff on the top floor. <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.m32.at/">Great restaurant</a> attached too, and we had a fine lunch overlooking the city, from the only location where you can&#8217;t see the Modern Art gallery, and missed the storm by minutes. The <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.residenzgalerie.at/">Rezidenz Gallery</a> has a great temporary exhibition about sleep, bringing together a collection of disparate pieces from all periods and media and weaving thematic threads through &#8211; works really well, and the permanent collection isn&#8217;t at all bad for what&#8217;s effectively a provincial gallery. The new <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.vivamozart.at/l_eng/index.html">Viva Mozart</a> exhibition, at the Neue Rezidenz is, I fear, a triumph of trendy modern curating over actual content, but they have a number of autograph scores on view, a fun exhibit where you can fade in or out various parts in a score, and a darkened room in which you can sit and listen to Mozart&#8217;s piano & wind quintet, a piece I didn&#8217;t know and have subsequently downloaded from itunes. We also made it to some fine baroque (or, as Clare characterized them, bling) churches, including at St Wolfgang and Maria Plein.

<p style="color: #495865;">
  We ate well, treating ourselves to a fine meal out overlooking the lake at<a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.schlossfuschl.at/">Schloss Fuschl</a> for our anniversary, although the hotel has been massively, and perhaps inappropriately, modernised and expanded since we last ate there in 2003. Very good traditional fair at the <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.hotel-brandstaetter.com/">Gasthof Brandstatter</a> just the other side of the motorway, and much more avant garde cooking for lunch on our last day at <a style="color: #008947;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061102114756/http://www.esszimmer.com/contex/frameset.html">Esszimmer</a>.
