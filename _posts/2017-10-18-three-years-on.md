Over the past seven years, England has undergone a major transformation in computing education. What began as an effort to overhaul an outdated ICT curriculum has evolved into a nationwide commitment to equipping young people with computational thinking, creativity, and the digital skills needed to navigate the modern world.

### The Journey to a New Curriculum
The journey began around 2010 when [a review of the National Curriculum](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7572c5ed915d6faf2b3104/NCR-Expert_Panel_Report.pdf) highlighted the need for change. In response, a diverse group of educators, industry professionals, and policymakers collaborated to design [a new computing curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study), which was introduced in schools three years ago. This was not merely an update but a complete shift in approach, moving from basic digital literacy to a structured subject encompassing **computer science, information technology, and digital literacy**.

Central to this shift was the belief that computing is not just about coding. The curriculum emphasises computational thinking — the ability to solve problems using logical reasoning and structured processes — as well as creativity and ethical considerations in digital technology. These elements ensure that students are not just users of technology but are empowered to understand and shape the digital world.

### Implementing Change in a Decentralised System
One of the unique aspects of England’s approach has been the decentralised nature of implementation. While the government mandated the curriculum, it largely left its delivery to schools, teachers, and industry partners. This ‘big society’ model encouraged collaboration between teachers, universities, tech companies, and professional organisations to develop resources, training programmes, and assessment tools.

The content of the curriculum itself is ambitious yet structured. Early years focus on problem-solving and creativity without reliance on computers. From age five, children begin learning about algorithms and sequences. By seven, they engage with block-based programming languages like Scratch, and by eleven, they transition to text-based programming, often using Python. At the secondary level, students explore more advanced concepts, including computational logic, classic algorithms, and practical programming projects.

### The Challenge of Teacher Training
A significant challenge has been equipping teachers — many of whom had no background in computer science — with the skills and confidence to teach computing effectively. Initial teacher training has had to evolve to include programming and computational thinking, while continuing professional development (CPD) has been essential in upskilling the existing teaching workforce. Initiatives like [Computing at Schools](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/) (CAS), the Network of Excellence, and the [Barefoot Computing](https://www.barefootcomputing.org/) programme have played a vital role in supporting teachers through peer networks, training hubs, and free resources.

### Assessing Progress
Assessment has also evolved. While project-based evaluation remains important, particularly at primary levels, multiple-choice diagnostic tools and coding challenges have been introduced to measure understanding more effectively. At GCSE level (age 16), students undertake programming projects under controlled conditions, while A-level students (age 18) complete more ambitious, open-ended software development tasks.

### Challenges and Opportunities
Despite strong progress, challenges remain. Gender disparity persists, with fewer girls choosing computing at GCSE and A-level. Efforts are underway to address this through targeted outreach, role models, and inclusive teaching strategies. Teacher recruitment also remains difficult, as there is a shortage of computer science specialists willing to enter the teaching profession. More incentives are needed to attract and retain qualified educators.

The university pipeline reflects an increase in students taking computer science, though institutions still prioritise maths over computing A-levels in admissions. Industry engagement continues to be crucial, ensuring that students gain practical experience with real-world applications of their skills.

### The Future of Computing Education
Looking ahead, the success of the curriculum will depend on ongoing investment in teacher training, high-quality resources, and effective assessment methods. The integration of computing with other subjects—such as using programming in mathematics or science—could also broaden its appeal and impact. As technology evolves, so too must computing education, ensuring that students are prepared for the careers and challenges of the digital age.

England’s approach to computing education demonstrates the power of collaboration between government, industry, and educators. By ensuring that every child, regardless of background, has access to high-quality computing education, we are fostering a generation of digitally literate, creative, and empowered problem-solvers. The journey is far from over, but the foundations have been laid for a future where computing is not just an optional skill but an essential part of every student’s education.
