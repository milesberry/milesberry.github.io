My first experiments with the [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net) site were with children&#8217;s reports: these were great, would make brilliant report covers, but alas pupil confidentiality prevents me posting them here!

The survey [Terry Freedman](http://www.terry-freedman.org.uk/) and I conducted last month of children&#8217;s use of technology outside school produced some great, if non representative, quantitative data, but also a fair number of qualitative responses which a former mathematician such as myself struggles to analyse. [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net) to the rescue! Here are the clouds generated from the five main write-in questions. I think they make very interesting reading. Do note the significance of games in all these!

Give examples of things you have learnt using technology that are not related to school work.

How could ICT at school be made more like ICT at home?

Which blocked websites do you think you should be able to access at school?
