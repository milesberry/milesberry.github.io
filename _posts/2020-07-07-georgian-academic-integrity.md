Academic integrity is central to the credibility of universities. It ensures that students earn degrees through honest effort and that institutions maintain their reputation. The [INTEGRITY](https://integrity.iliauni.edu.ge/) project, launched in 2017, aimed to improve academic integrity across Georgian higher education institutions. Funded by the EU’s Erasmus+ programme, the project brought together universities from Georgia and Europe to create policies, tools, and practices that promote integrity in academic work.

### The Georgian Context

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia underwent significant educational reforms. Under Soviet rule, obedience to authority was prioritised over critical thinking, leading to an academic culture where plagiarism and rote learning were widespread. The 2004 education reforms introduced standardised university entrance exams and ended free higher education, shifting to a system of scholarships and grants. However, academic integrity remained a challenge due to low awareness, weak enforcement, and a lack of resources for plagiarism detection.

The 2016 report [The Problem of Plagiarism and Its Perceptions in Georgia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358069844_The_Problem_of_Plagiarism_and_Its_Perceptions_in_Georgia) highlighted key issues in the country’s academic system. It found that while universities had official policies against plagiarism, enforcement was weak. Many faculty members, students, and administrators lacked a clear understanding of academic integrity, and institutions had limited access to plagiarism detection tools. Additionally, Georgian universities often followed a hierarchical approach to knowledge, discouraging independent thought and originality.

### The Role of the INTEGRITY Project

The INTEGRITY project aimed to develop a comprehensive approach to fostering academic integrity in Georgia. Led by Ilia State University, it involved four European universities—Vienna, Uppsala, Dublin City, and Roehampton—alongside 12 Georgian universities and Georgia’s Ministry of Education and Science. The project’s objectives included:

* Implementing plagiarism detection software across Georgian universities.

* Conducting a public awareness campaign on academic integrity.

* Training university staff on effective assessment, teaching, and learning practices.

* Developing support services to enhance students’ writing skills.

* Reviewing academic writing curricula to ensure a focus on integrity and critical thinking.

* Establishing policies and resources to promote ethical academic practices.

Each European partner took the lead in a specific workstream. Vienna focused on student support services, Uppsala on quality assurance, Dublin on staff training and plagiarism detection, and Roehampton on academic writing curricula and institutional policies.

### Collaboration and Capacity Building

The project was built on collaboration between European and Georgian institutions. While European universities provided expertise and resources, the solutions had to be tailored to Georgia’s specific context. This meant face-to-face meetings in Georgia and Europe, where partners could share ideas and develop locally appropriate approaches.

A key element was the introduction of [Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.co.uk/), a plagiarism detection software, across Georgian universities. European partners demonstrated how institutions used tools like Turnitin, iThenticate, and Urkund for originality checking. Funding was allocated to ensure all participating Georgian institutions had access to Turnitin, though early usage was primarily for plagiarism detection rather than broader academic feedback.

### Progress and Challenges

By early 2020, the project had seen notable progress. The number of active students using Turnitin increased by 99% between 2017 and 2019, while active lecturers rose by 315%. However, overall submissions increased by only 22%, indicating that widespread adoption was still a work in progress.

One major challenge was encouraging faculty members to use Turnitin for feedback and assessment rather than just plagiarism detection. In many institutions, Turnitin was managed by library and student support services rather than being integrated into regular coursework. The European partners recommended a targeted internal PR campaign to promote the broader benefits of Turnitin among faculty members.

Another key milestone was the planned signing of a declaration by the rectors of all 13 Georgian partner universities, committing to the long-term promotion of academic integrity. This was scheduled for June 2020, later postponed to October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of this initiative would depend on strong leadership and institutional commitment.

### Lessons for Academic Integrity

The INTEGRITY project offered several insights into promoting academic integrity, many of which are relevant beyond Georgia. One key takeaway was that integrity is not just about catching students who cheat; it is about fostering a culture of honesty and trust in academic institutions. This requires a combination of education, policies, and enforcement mechanisms.

Academic writing played a central role in the project. While European universities generally embed academic writing within discipline-specific modules, Georgian institutions offer dedicated courses. These courses provide a consistent foundation for critical reading, referencing, and research ethics. The project helped Georgian universities review and refine their curricula, ensuring they supported integrity while respecting local academic traditions.

Another important discussion was around how to respond to plagiarism. Some Georgian institutions initially favoured a zero-tolerance approach, expelling students for any violation. However, through discussions with European partners, many adopted a more proportionate response. Minor infractions, such as missing citations, were handled differently from serious cases, like data falsification. This balanced approach helped ensure that academic integrity policies were both fair and educational.

The project also highlighted the importance of cultural awareness. Academic integrity means different things in different contexts. In some cultures, reusing authoritative texts without citation is seen as a sign of respect rather than plagiarism. Recognising these differences helps institutions design more effective training programmes for students from diverse backgrounds.

### The Future of Academic Integrity

While the INTEGRITY project made significant strides in promoting academic integrity in Georgia, its long-term impact depends on continued efforts from universities and policymakers. Senior leadership buy-in is crucial, as is ongoing training for staff and students. Universities must also integrate plagiarism detection tools into regular teaching and assessment practices rather than treating them as standalone enforcement mechanisms.

More broadly, the project raises important questions for all academic institutions. How can universities ensure that students see integrity as a core value rather than a set of rules to follow? How should institutions balance enforcement with education? And what role does academic writing play in developing students’ critical thinking and reasoning skills?

By addressing these questions, universities can build a culture where integrity is not just a requirement but a shared commitment to academic excellence.
