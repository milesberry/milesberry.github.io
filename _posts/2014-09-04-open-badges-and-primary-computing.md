[Rising Stars](http://risingstars-uk.com) have been working with [Makewav.es](https://www.makewav.es/) to develop [a set of digital badges](https://www.makewav.es/badges/18419/) to support assessment for the primary computing curriculum, with each of the programme of study bullet points mapped to its own badge. These are linked to the outcomes from units in [Switched on Computing](http://www.risingstars-uk.com/all-series/switched-on-computing/?offset=all), but as they&#8217;re available to all Makewav.es users (free registration required) and are based on the programme of study content I think they&#8217;d work very well for schools using their own or other schemes of work too.

As these are based on [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/)&#8216;s excellent [Open Badge](http://www.openbadges.org/) infrasturcture, the badges are portable so can be converted into Open Badges when pupils hit the age of thirteen and can create their own personal Open Badge accounts.

I&#8217;d see this as a great way to record and reward pupils&#8217; attainment against the statutory attainment target for the new curriculum:

> By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.
