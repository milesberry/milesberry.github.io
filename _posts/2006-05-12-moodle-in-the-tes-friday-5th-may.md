My article in last week&#8217;s TES Online on how we&#8217;ve used Moodle at St Ives is now [online](http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2230925) in their web archive.

> &#8220;The vision for the learning environment at St Ives was simple &#8211; to use Moodle and the internet to make the best aspects of our classroom practice available to pupils when they work at home&#8230; Online communities, co-created by teachers and learners, seem far more appropriate in primary education than a one-dimensional &#8220;learning platform&#8221; that presents individualised sequences of resources for learners to work through at their own pace.&#8221;
