[JISC](http://jisc.ac.uk/)’s [Regional Support Centre for North and East Scotland](http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.ac.uk/) have won this year’s [Scottish Open Source Award for Educational Excellence](http://scottishopensourceawards.co.uk/index.php) for their AccessApps initiative.
  
AccessApps, like the better know [PortableApps](http://portableapps.com/), is a suite of open source and freeware applications that run directly off a USB memory stick on a Windows computer. The distinctive feature of AccessApps is the clear focus on assistive technology and accessibility tools, such as the AMIS book reader, the Dasher mouse based predictive text entry system and a virtual magnifying glass, alongside open source favourites such as Audacity, Firefox and the Gimp.
