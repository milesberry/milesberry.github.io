I have a piece in today&#8217;s TES Magazine about using dynamic geometry software for exploring symmetry on an interactive whiteboard:

> The lesson starts with a little mental arithmetic, but soon turns into interactive geometry using a computer, projector and input device. It works well on an interactive whiteboard. But you could just use a wireless mouse, which is easier to manage because it can be passed round the class without the need for pupils to come to up to the board.
> 
> You’ll also need some dynamic geometry software. The commercial leaders are Geometer’s Sketchpad and Cabri, both of which run on Mac and Windows; GeoGebra and Kig are good open source alternatives. GeoGebra will run happily inside a learning platform as well as on a desktop.
