Yesterday the <span>DfE</span> published the [revised version of the Teachers&#8217; Standards](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/reviewofstandards) (<span>ie</span> <span>QTS</span> requirements).

Whilst I&#8217;m disappointed that there&#8217;s no mention of technology this time round, and a bit surprised that subject pedagogy doesn&#8217;t appear to get a look in beyond synthetic phonics and &#8216;early mathematics&#8217; (Euclid? Pythagoras?), there&#8217;s much here that is, to my mind, very positive, <span>eg</span>

  * &#8220;demonstrate a critical understanding of developments in the subject and curriculum areas, and promote the value of scholarship&#8221; (<span>3b</span>)
  * &#8220;promote a love of learning and childrenâ€™s intellectual curiosity&#8221; (<span>4b</span>)
  * &#8220;reflect systematically on the effectiveness of lessons and approaches to teaching&#8221; (<span>4c</span>)

The revised standards include elements to replace the <span>GTCE&#8217;s</span> code of conduct, and thus include requirements such as:

  * &#8220;Teachers uphold public trust in the profession and maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour, within _and outside_ school&#8221; [italics added]
