Behaviour management is one of the most daunting challenges for new teachers, and computing brings its own complexities. In a computer lab, pupils are surrounded by devices that they may associate with games, social media, and entertainment. It is easy for them to see computers as toys rather than learning tools. Without clear expectations, lessons can quickly unravel.

During the opening weeks of the course, we emphasise to trainees that behaviour is not something that simply “happens” when rules are read out or policies are displayed on the wall. Behaviour needs to be taught, just like literacy, numeracy, or programming. Pupils are not born knowing how to line up quietly, listen to instructions, or work collaboratively. These routines and habits have to be modelled, practised, and reinforced over time.

The same is true for self-discipline. Many pupils will not yet have developed the skills to manage their own focus and motivation. Our role as teachers is to teach these behaviours explicitly, especially in the early weeks of term. This might include showing pupils how to enter the room, where to sit, when to log on, and how to ask for help without disrupting others. Trainees need to see that these routines are part of their teaching, not an optional extra.

In computing, this explicit teaching is even more important. The physical environment of a computer room creates unique pressures. Pupils may rush to switch on screens, open games, or visit websites before the lesson has even begun. Experienced teachers establish firm rules: computers stay off or screens stay down until the teacher says otherwise. Some use paper-based starters to focus attention before moving to the computers. These simple strategies prevent low-level disruption and signal that learning is purposeful from the outset.

Mentors play a central role in helping trainees understand and implement these approaches. It is vital that mentors explain the “why” behind school routines as well as the “what.” For example, lining up outside the classroom may seem like a small detail, but it creates a calm, orderly entry and gives the teacher a chance to greet pupils by name and check uniform. Similarly, assigned seating in computing rooms is not just about fairness: it allows teachers to place pupils strategically, with those needing more support or closer supervision near the front.

Engagement and behaviour are closely linked. When pupils are engaged, behaviour issues decrease. Computing can be a hugely motivating subject, but it can also lead to frustration if pupils struggle with programming or complex problem-solving. When tasks feel too difficult or too abstract, pupils may give up and seek distraction. Trainees need guidance in planning lessons that balance challenge and success. Short, well-structured tasks with clear outcomes help maintain motivation.

Real-world context is another powerful tool for engagement. A lesson on cybersecurity might connect to protecting personal data on social media. A programming task could involve creating a simple game or tool with a purpose pupils care about. When pupils see why a topic matters, they are more willing to persist through difficulties. Mentors can share examples of how they frame lessons in meaningful ways and encourage trainees to adapt these ideas for their own classes.

Behaviour management is not just about stopping negative actions. It is about actively teaching positive behaviours and building relationships. Pupils need to feel respected and valued. Something as simple as greeting pupils at the door, using their names, and acknowledging their effort can build trust. At the same time, boundaries must be clear and consistent. Friendly does not mean permissive.

For trainees, this balance is difficult to strike. Early lessons may feel chaotic. It is common for new teachers to underestimate how long routines take to establish or how explicit they need to be. Mentors should model these routines and give trainees structured opportunities to practise them. Co-teaching can be effective: the mentor leads part of the lesson while the trainee focuses on observing and reinforcing routines, then responsibility gradually shifts.

Debrief conversations after lessons are vital. Feedback should focus on specific behaviours, not just general impressions. Instead of saying, “You need to improve behaviour management,” a mentor might suggest, “Next time, wait for silence before giving instructions and use a countdown to gain attention.” Highlighting even small successes helps build a trainee’s confidence.

As trainees grow in experience, they should begin to see behaviour management as part of their subject teaching rather than something separate. Computing lessons provide many opportunities to teach self-discipline alongside technical skills. For instance, pupils can learn to debug systematically, to work collaboratively on shared projects, and to reflect on their own progress. These are valuable life skills as well as academic ones.

Mentors should also remind trainees that setbacks are normal. Behaviour patterns take time to change, and even experienced teachers face challenging classes. When a lesson goes badly, mentors can help trainees analyse what happened and plan one small, achievable step to try next time. The aim is steady progress, not instant perfection.

At the heart of this work is the relationship between the mentor, the trainee, and the pupils. A well-managed computing classroom is not just quiet and orderly. It is a space where curiosity and creativity flourish, where mistakes are part of learning, and where technology is a tool rather than a distraction.

Behaviour is taught, engagement is built, and self-discipline is nurtured. With the guidance of skilled mentors, trainees can develop the confidence to lead such classrooms. In doing so, they not only manage behaviour but also inspire young people to see themselves as capable creators in a digital world.
