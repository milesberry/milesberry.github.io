<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There is a problem here: at <a href="http://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results/gcses/2015/gcse-and-entry-level-certificate-results-summer-2015"><span class="s2">GCSE</span></a>, only 16% of the entries in computing were from girls; at <a href="http://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results/a-levels/2015/a-as-and-aea-results-summer-2015"><span class="s2">A Level</span></a>, this drops to just 8%. Only 456 girls took A level computing last year!</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So what can be done? Including computing on the curriculum for all is part of the solution I think. Back in 2011, <a href="http://www.emmamulqueeny.com/"><span class="s2">Emma Mulqueeny</span></a> argued that â€˜<a href="https://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/year-8-is-too-late/"><span class="s2">Year 8 was too late</span></a>â€™: if girls get interested in coding and computer science, theyâ€™re perhaps more likely to continue that interest into secondary school and beyond. Itâ€™ll be some time before we find out whether or not this turns out to be the case, but I for one am optimistic.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the video, Carrie Anne argues for more positive role models for women in computing, and there are many heroes that we could cite, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace"><span class="s2">Ada Lovelace</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"><span class="s2">Grace Hopper</span></a> through to <a href="https://blackse.wordpress.com/"><span class="s2">Sue Black</span></a> and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~wh"><span class="s2">Wendy Hall</span></a>. These though, perhaps, seem a bit distant from secondary school pupils. I love Carrie Anneâ€™s idea of teachers drawing on their own students as role models, with female sixthformers helping out with KS3 classes for example.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Carrie Anneâ€™s point about girls enjoying more authentic, practical, collaborative, projects, ideally with some altruistic purpose is well made, and well worth thinking about. Thereâ€™s some great work going on in Key Stage 3, such as through projects such as <a href="http://www.appsforgood.org/"><span class="s2">Apps For Good</span></a>, and at A Level or university, project work can take into account just these sorts of opportunities (although awarding organisations tend to frown on the collaborationâ€¦). Iâ€™m less sure how appealing GCSE controlled tasks are to girls, or indeed many boys.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The key message though is more about teaching computing <i>better</i>, in a more inclusive way, rather than one which is designed to, or perhaps just by accident, appeals to one gender more than another. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s well worth departments thinking hard, and discussing honestly, what they might do about this in their school.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Is this a problem in your school? How have you got on with making computing more inclusive for girls? Or indeed, better for boys and girls?</span>
