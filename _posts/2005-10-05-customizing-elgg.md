A few technical gliches getting the standard themes working properly in our installation, but we&#8217;re there now (Thanks, Dave), and the personalization idea has really captured my pupils imagination, and has won a few converts to the &#8216;Elgg&#8217;s better than Moodle&#8217; contingent.

The actual blogging is going well, too. About half of the cohort are using it for themselves, rather than waiting for the lessons, which is pretty good I reckon. These extra posts are not, on the whole, centred on school subjects, but it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if that changes over time.<!--more-->

The degree to which their posts represent relfection varies a fair bit, but even just providing the space is getting some of them thinking more about what they&#8217;d like to say. Here&#8217;s one which I thought deserved a wider audience:

> **European Day**
> 
> European Day was really fun especially in the afternoon when we had to show the tables. The trouble was whenever someone came over to look at our table, [my friends] showed them the rollmop herrings so everyone disappeared. Also in the afternoon we had a quiz which was about Europe. For the day I had come dressed for Sweden and the writer of Pippi Longstocking came from Sweden so when this question came along I knew the answer straight away, this is the question, &#8220;Which country does the writer of Pippi Longstocking come from. &#8221;
  
> The year threes in our group kept on saying that the answers to the questions where either Scotland or Italy.
> 
> Keywords: Europe, European Day, Herrings, Italy, Pippi Longstocking, quiz, Scotland, Sweden

Also, they&#8217;re doing a fair bit of commenting on one another&#8217;s posts now, so the social network side seems to be working well.

We&#8217;ve also taken the decision to put a few of their posts out onto the school website, so that at least some of their writing will get a wider audience, without raising too many child protection concerns.
