Just discovered that the lectures from University of California Berkeley&#8217;s Beauty and Joy of Computing course for non-specialists are all [online on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLECBD29A17AAF6EF9&feature=plcp). They, like us at Roehampton, use BYOB as their programming toolkit &#8211; indeed, one of the lecturers, Brian Harvey, is coauthor of BYOB&#8217;s modifications to Scratch.

Their [Moodle course](http://sage.cs.berkeley.edu/course/view.php?id=21) allows guest access.
