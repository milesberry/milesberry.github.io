I have [an article](http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2230925) in today&#8217;s TES Mgazine looking at open source applications that can be installed on a school webserver, in addition to Moodle, of course.

> Interested in letting your pupils reap the benefits of Web 2.0, collaborative content and social networks for learning? Worried about their web safety, exposure to commercialism or keeping track of what they do? Why not run your own versions of these web-based applications in- house, inside your schoolâ€™s network where they are that bit safer and you can keep an eye on it all?&#8230;
