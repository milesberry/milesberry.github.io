An article in today&#8217;s TES about ways in which schools might encourage more pupils to take up places in science, technology, engineering and maths, including comments from me and others involved with [Computing at School](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/):

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8220;With an extra 10,000 undergraduate places in &#8216;Stem&#8217; subjects, how can teachers encourage sixth formers to take the technical route into higher education? Hannah Frankel reports</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>So you thought the dot-com bust in 2001 spelt the end of the computing boom? Well, that&#8217;s not what the Government thinks. Despite the chronic shortage of university places this autumn, it recently announced 10,000 extra undergraduate places for the so-called &#8220;Stem&#8221; subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths.&#8221;</em>
