What would you look for in a good computing department? Here's a personal perspective on this, but you might well have your own thoughts.

## Good uptake of CS qualifications

I'd expect a good proportion of pupils to be going on to study computer science at GCSE and at A Level, at least in line with the national figures, althought that's not a particularly high bar (12.5% at GCSE, c. 2% at A Level last year). Good numbers at GCSE are indicative of a strong, engaging KS3 curriculum, and are likely to reflect an inclusive approach to recruitment to these courses. A level teaching, even if to only 2% of the cohort, reflects a positive attitude to the subject on behalf of senior leadership as well as a depth of subject knowledge in the department. Whilst A Level computing should be seen as a useful qualification for anyone looking at STEM (or social science) disciplines at university, I'd expect that a good department would also have a steady stream of folks heading off to read computer science or IT at uni, as well as on pathways into technology careers and maybe a few starting their own tech related businesses.

## Fair representation

Once computing becomes optional in a school (usually at Key Stage 4, despite the requirements of the national curriculum), we encounter a well documented diversity issue. In 2019-20, 22% of computing entries at GCSE were from girls, compared to 49% of the whole year group. In [previous years](/docs/TRACER_2017.pdf) we've also seen under-representation of pupils with SEN/D, in receipt of pupil premium and amongst black students. I'd say that a good computing department would have addressed this, and would have the proportion of girls, pupils with SEN/D, pupil premium pupils and black pupils on elective computing courses broadly comparable to the proportions in the school as a whole, or at least have measures in place to address under-representation in these groups.

## Some computing at KS4 for those not taking GCSE computer science

For local authority schools, there's a statutory entitlement for pupils to be taught some computing at Key Stage 4, although the actual requirements are remarkably unambitious. I'd expect that good computing departments were making some provision for all pupils in Key Stages 4 and 5 to continue to develop IT skills, critial digital literacy and perhaps even some coding, whether or not pupils are studying GCSE or A Level CS. One option here would be to include some other qualifications, such as iMedia, in the options menu alongside GCSE CS, although again there would be the need to ensure that there was some provision for pupils not taking any of these courses leading to qualifications. Another possibility, and I have some preference for this, would be the inclusion of some useful computing content across the curriculum: media projects in English, GIS use in geography, data analysis in maths lessons, creating some simulations in science, generative music or art, debates about ethical issues in RE, etc. The challenge is finding time for this when it's not required by the exam specs in the other subjects, and overcoming this is likely to need some direction from senior leadership.



## Good links with feeder primaries

I'd hope that a good secondary computing department was pro-active in making links with its feeder primary schools, making sure that there was a sense of recognising all the great work that happens in primaries and making a real effort to build on that in Year 7, rather than simply reteaching the topics that pupils had already covered. On the other hand, where primary provision hadn't lived up to the requirements of the national curriculum, or individual pupils hadn't mastered the content that had been taught, I'd hope secondary schools had mechanisms in place to identify the gaps and make sure these were addressed early on, before disadvantaged pupils fall further behind. I'd see a place for regular meet-ups between secondary and primary teachers, perhaps through [CAS](http://computingatschool.org.uk) or more arranged more locally, as well as some form of baseline assessment early on in Year 7, as well as some outreach style opportunities, perhaps involving sixth form CS students in creative computing projects in local primary schools.

## Effective pedagogy

I'd expect that a good computing department is using evidence based, effective approaches to teaching computing, and particularly programming. I think we're approaching a broad consensus on what such approaches would include, perhaps based on Rosenshine's [Principles of Instruction](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Rosenshine.pdf) for a general approach which includes the following:

- Begin a lesson with a short review of previous learning.
- Present new material in small steps with student practice after each step.
- Ask a large number of questions and check the responses of all students.
- Provide models.
- Guide student practice.
- Check for student understanding.
- Obtain a high success rate.
- Provide scaffolds for difficult tasks.
- Require and monitor independent practice.
- Engage students in weekly and monthly review.

I don't think there's anything on this list that doesn't apply to teaching computing. 

For CS, and particularly for programming, there is some excellent advice available online, including the following:

- Shuchi Grover’s (2016) [teaching tips](https://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/7081/original.pdf) (p7)
- Paul Curzon on [learning to learn to program](https://teachinglondoncomputing.org/learning-to-learn-to-program/)
- Neil Brown and Greg Wilson (2018) [Ten quick tips for teaching programming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886386/).
- Colleen Lewis [CSTeachingTips](https://www.csteachingtips.org/) website.
- [How we teach computing](https://raspberrypi-education.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Pedagogy+Assets/NCCE_pedagogy_principles.pdf) from Teach Computing

I've spoken about this on a [few occasions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v7l4bFPDjZEHYxztGYSnrRRQBWe7kjo6B7Gx3mOag8Q/edit?usp=sharing), and suggest these ten ideas: be honest (ie don't over promise) about computational thinking; teach problem solving; label subgoals; scaffold notional machines; teach pupils to reason about code; collaborate in programming; collaborate when learning theory too;  develop a growth mindset for programing; plan for the long term; don't rush on from block-based programming. 

Whilst the pedagogy of computing continues to evolve as we become better at teaching it, I think schools will develop their own approaches too, but I'd hope to see them basing these on their own and others evidence of what works.

## Creative computing

I would site computing firmly amongst the creative, practical subjects in the school curriculum. I recognise that being creative in computing, particularly in programming, demands detailed theoretical knowledge as well as some fluency in practical skills. My own experience of learning to program in multiple languages suggests that creative practical work provides the motivation and insight necessary for learning the theory, in line with Papert's constructionism:

> Constructionism shares constructivism's connotation of learning as "building knowledge structures"... It then adds the idea that this happens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity

Simon Peyton Jones [puts it well](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/why-coding-matters/):

> Coding is not the message of the new computing curriculum: it is its medium. Coding is the labwork of computer science: it motivates, illuminates, and brings to life the dry bones of theory. Without programming, computer science would be a dry, theoretical husk of a subject.

I've seen too many lessons where the theory is taught at a distance from the coding: for example where pupils practice converting numbers between base 2 and 10 by hand, rather than programming their machines to do this, or where they implement binary search or bubble sort using decks of cards rather than actually programming these standard algorithms. I have a strong suspicion that this dry, theoretical approach is what puts too many off continuing wioth the subject at GCSE or A Level. 

The same is true of other aspects of computing - working in digital media, understanding computer networks and key elements of digital literacy such as privacy and security offer scope ample for creative, or at least practical, work.

## Planning for progression

I'd expect that good computing departments would have thought long and hard about how to best sequence their schemes of work. 

Computing is a hierachical subject, and some constructs logically require prior mastery of others (see, e.g. [the K-5 learning trajectories work from Everyday Computing](http://everydaycomputing.org/public/visualization/)). Computing also lends itself to a 'spiral' curriculum model, with some topics revisited in greater depth or broader contexts from one year to the next - for example programming constructs such as repetition and data structures, online safety and responsibility and creating content for the web. A good department would also look for the opportunities to make the connections *within* computing - if pupils are working with image filters in Photoshop (or similar), they should also look at how pixel colour values can be manipulated directly using Snap!, GP or Pillow; it they're making use of speech to text tools for wordprocessing or for adding captions to videos, they can use these in their own programs too and learn about how these work. 

The repetition of the central constructs of computing, as well as making explicit the links across the subject provide scope for the retrieval practice, interleaving and spaced repetition that helps to make knowledge stick.

## The timetable

Good computing needs time.At Key Stage 3, I think schools may struggle to cover all the programme of study requirements without at least an hour a week of computing, although it might be possible to do so if there's enough IT and critical digital literacy embedded elsehwere in the curriculum, leaving computing lessons to focus on the extensive computer science content included for this age. I'm concerned that the time allocated to computing for 11-14 year olds has dropped significantly from 77,000 hours for ICT in 2011 to 51,000  for computing in 2019, despite the increase in curriculum content during this period.

At GCSE, I'd expect two and a half hours a week to be the minimum, 





How much time is given to computing? Is this enough?
Are there areas where you have gone beyond the NC / exam specifications with some or all pupils? Why?
Are there areas where you have not fully covered the NC / exam specifications with some or all pupils? Why?
Explain how you constructed your scheme of work for computing. Why did you sequence topics in this way? 
How do you ensure balance across the different elements of the computing curriculum? Is this true of all key stages?
How is computing assessed? How do you ensure reliability, validity, equity and manageability of this approach?
What proportion of pupils meet the expectations of the statutory attainment target: "By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.”? How do you know?
What does the department do to nurture a love of the subject in pupils?
What computing-specific professional development have computing teachers undertaken in the last twelve months? How effective was this? How do you know?
Are the resources you have, including IT equipment, sufficient for delivering the curriculum? Would you do more if you had better facilities? 
What do you do to help pupils see the connections within computing? Do they use their computing skills and knowledge elsewhere in the school’s curriculum too?
Are there pupils, or groups of pupils, who find computing uninteresting or challenging? What are your strategies to engage or support them?
Are there pupils, or groups of pupils, who find computing particularly exciting or easy? What are your strategies to nurture their love of the subject or to challenge them?
