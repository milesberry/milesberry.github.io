The full text of the framework agreement for those wishing to supply learning platforms to local authorites and RBCs is on the <acronym title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</acronym> website, try [here](http://ted.publications.eu.int/official/ojs/tender/EN/2006043062.html).<!--more-->

Key facts are that those wishing to tender need net worth in excess of Â£700,000, a Dun & Bradstreet minimum risk indicator of at least 3 (!?), and three years of audited accounts, although these criteria may be relaxed in the case of consortia of SMEs. They&#8217;ll also need to provide a history of major education sector contracts and successful learning platform implementations.

It seems obvious to me that RBCs and Local Authorities would get far better [value for money](http://www.becta.org.uk/corporate/publications/documents/BEC5606_Full_report18.pdf) by hosting solutions like Moodle and Elgg in-house, and using the funding to pay for development, support, training and content, rather than paying towards licence fees, profits and dividends.
