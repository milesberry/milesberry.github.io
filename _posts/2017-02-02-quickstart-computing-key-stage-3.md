At BETT last week we launched the Key Stage 3 edition of QuickStart Computing. The PDF of this is now available online at [bit.ly/qsks3](http://bit.ly/qsks3).

This is the third book in the QuickStart computing set. It broadly follows the structure of the [QuickStart Computing primary handbook](http://primary.quickstartcomputing.org/resources/pdf/qs_handbook.pdf), extending the subject knowledge coverage into the Key Stage 3 computing curriculum. It also acts as a companion to the [QuickStart Computing secondary handbook](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/4974/original.pdf), which addresses classroom matters such as planning, teaching and assessing computing.

Our aim has been to produce a one volume survey of the computer science, IT and digital literacy knowledge needed to teach national curriculum computing to 11-14 year olds, in a way that's accessible to secondary school teachers who find themselves teaching computing to this age group without a background in computer science or software engineering themselves. The chapters here cover computational thinking, the golden thread that runs through the English computing curriculum; programming with both block-based and text-based languages; the technologies and concepts that underpin computer systems, such as Boolean logic and binary representation; how the internet, the world wide web and search engines operate; how computers can be used productively, creatively and collaboratively; and finally the principles of safe, responsible and secure use of online and other technologies.

We've assumed that readers already have a good idea of _how_ to teach, and how they can use technology to enhance or extend their lessons. However, as well as the subject knowledge content here, we've also included lots of practical suggestions for _teaching_ these topics, and links to some of the best resources, activities and references that are freely available for each topic. The book is intended for individual study and reference, but could easily form the basis of a in-school professional development, as did the two earlier QuickStart guides.
