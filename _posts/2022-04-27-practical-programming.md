## Executive summary  

This white paper argues for the fundamental importance of practical programming as a central element of our young people's computing education. Our intended audience is senior leaders, heads of computing, and teachers, especially in secondary schools.

In 2014 the new English computing curriculum re-envisioned computing as
a foundational subject, rooted in a body of knowledge and ideas, rather
than as a vocational one. A danger is that the pendulum swings too far:
that we come to see computing as a mainly
theoretical discipline, divorced from the practical activities
that animate it, including programming. The truth is that practical
programming is absolutely central to a good education in computing, for
three main reasons:

-   Programming is intrinsic to computing. Programming is both a
    means to an end and an end in itself. Could you imagine a
    good education in science without science labs, in music without
    performance, in English without creative writing (only reading)? The
    whole purpose of computing is to build things that change
    the way we live, work and play, so actually writing programs is key.
     See Section 1.

-   Programming skills in computing are exceptionally useful.
    Programming is extraordinarily useful in other domains, not just the
    software industry. Moreover, programming projects develop many of
    the "soft skills" that are so highly prized by employers: teamwork,
    planning, logical thinking, communication skills, and resilience.
    See Section 2.

-   Programming work is essential pedagogy. Designing, writing,
    predicting, and debugging programs brings together the theoretical
    knowledge that students encounter in class, consolidates and
    integrates theoretical understanding, and is incredibly motivating.
    See Section 3.

This is a particularly opportune moment to emphasise programming as part
of the taught curriculum. In 2019 Ofqual removed Non-Examined Assessment
from the grade of GCSE Computer Science. Many schools read this as a
signal that practical work is not important. But that is completely
backwards! The real message is that programming work is too important
to be conducted in 20-hour hermetically-controlled assessments. It is hard to imagine a less authentic or motivating setting. Rather,
freed from the onerous demands of formally-assessed work, schools are
now able to design imaginative, creative, and ambitious programming
projects in computing, incorporating collaboration and teamwork,
connections to "live" data, industrial mentors, and iterative review
that strongly supports learning. Section 4 suggests some ideas.

Our call to action is:

**Computing subject leaders and teachers:** ensure that
practical programming is deeply integrated in your scheme of work, in
diverse forms ranging from program comprehensions, through short
exercises, up to capstone projects (see Sections 4 and 5).

**Senior leaders:** actively support your computing
department to make rich, creative practical programming a priority in
your computing timetable, and in your resourcing, at every Key Stage.

## 1. Programming is intrinsic to computer science

The importance of programming is explicit in one of the four Aims of
[the National Curriculum for
computing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study):

>All pupils can analyse problems in computational terms, and have
repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to
solve such problems.

But why? Â Because programmingis not just a means to an
end: it is a fundamental part of the subject itself, just
as music performance is fundamental to music, and writing is as
fundamental to English as reading. A computing education without
programming would be a dry eviscerated husk, shorn not just of
motivation and enjoyment, but of intrinsic content.

The whole purpose of computer science is to help us build things. As
Fred Brooks [put
it](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/Toolsmith-CACM.pdf):

>"the
natural scientist builds in order to study; but the engineer
studies in order to build". 

He goes on: 

>"[ submit that by any
reasonable criterion the discipline we call "computer science" is in
fact not a science but a synthetic, an engineering, discipline. We are
concerned with making things, be they computers, algorithms, or software
systems."

In reality, computer science is both (and much
more too). However, studying in order to build is a fundamental
part.

So building things (programming) is not an optional add-on to the
subject: it is a key raison d'etre of the subject itself.

The [Gatsby report on Good Practical
Science](http://www.gatsby.org.uk/uploads/education/reports/pdf/good-practical-science-report.pdf) makes
the case for practical science in a similar way. For example, it says

>"Experimentation gives science its identity. Science uses experiments
to discover the realities underlying the world, and this practical
approach seems to be as intrinsic to young learners as it is to
professional researchers." 

The [Ofsted Research Review on
Science](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-review-series-science/research-review-series-science%23practical-work) makes
a similar case: 

>"At its heart, science involves the study of the
material world. Practical work therefore forms a fundamental part of
learning science because it connects scientific concepts and procedures
to the phenomena and methods being studied."

Computer science can be considered as 'the silent C' in CSTEM, and it is
through programming that the linkages with science, technology,
engineering and mathematics are most strongly manifested.

-   **Science**. Programming, and particularly debugging, embodies
    repeated experience of the scientific method: gathering information
    through observation, formulating a hypothesis, devising experiments
    to test it, refining the hypothesis, all in service of developing a
    better mental model of the system. Programming also makes possible
    new realms of scientific discovery ('computational science'). It
    also gives a new powerful way to do science that complements
    experimentation, that has revolutionised scientific method, for
    example, through simulation and virtual experiments, and through
    discovery via machine learning.
-   **Technology.** Programming is also about acquiring mastery over
    technology through making the computer carry out your own
    instructions. In today's world much technology is digital
    technology, and thus owes its existence to programming. Only by
    understanding programming can a student deeply understand the
    possibilities and limitations of existing technology: how it could
    be better or modified to do new things, for example. Also often
    programming skills are needed to have mastery over technology:
    expert use of spreadsheets is one clear example, among many.
-   **Engineering**. Programming, like engineering more generally,
    is concerned with making or building things, and whilst programs are
    less physically tangible than bridges or circuit boards, their
    impact on our lives is no less significant. Programmed artefacts are
    also often now a key part of engineered ones and are often used as a
    tool to do engineering. Engineering now relies heavily on
    programming. 
-   **Mathematics**. There are strong parallels between mathematical
    reasoning and computational thinking (the key skills underpinning
    programming). Polya's How to Solve It, whilst originally about
    mathematical problem solving, applies just as readily to computer
    programming today. The subject of Mathematics uses abstraction to
    represent real world things in mathematics, perhaps numerically,
    algebraically or as more complex structures. Similarly programmers
    represent real world things (including text, images and sound)
    digitally, as code, or in data structures with their own properties
    and methods. Mathematical thinking and programming skills are
    complementary and the practice of each supports the other in deep
    ways. Programming can also be seen as mathematics in practice: a
    form of applied mathematics, turning underpinning mathematics into
    artefacts that do things in the world.

It's not just STEM subjects though!  Programming links to, and is a
useful skill, in the arts and humanities too (in fact all other
subjects). For example:

-   **English**. A key and often sadly neglected part of programming
    is that of documentation. Clear written explanations of what code
    does, and how, is vital to help limit the mistakes in large software
    systems and the maintainability of the code.
-   **Design and Creativity**. Programming and other forms of
    practical work are inherently creative. Good design is an important
    part of good programming. It is good design of the user interface,
    for example, that makes a program usable (or not).
-   **Social sciences**. A key step in developing software is to
    understand the problem you are solving first. As problems are often
    problems being solved for people, it is often the contexts of people
    and society that need to be understood. Social sciences methods such
    as interviewing people to understand their needs is key to real
    software development, for example. 
-   **Art.** The virtual world provides whole new mediums for
    creating art and whole new techniques for doing so. An artist who
    can program has a vast new toolset to work with, whether explicitly
    programming the artwork, developing programs that support doing so,
    or writing artificial intelligence programs that create the artworks
    themselves.

## 2. Programming teaches exceptionally useful skills

In school computing, we should aim to develop in learners the necessary
knowledge and skills to be able to use computing practically in
other areas of their lives, e.g. in other school subjects, in the jobs
they will take up, or when studying other subjects at university. The
practical programming that we argue is so essential in school lays the
foundation for this practical use of the subject in all these other
areas. For example:

-   **Digital literacy.** Every child needs to be digitally literate,
    a confident and competent user of computer systems: the fourth aim
    of the [computing national
    curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study).
    Programming underpins that competence, by giving the learner an
    accurate understanding of what is really going on, rather than just
    guessing and trying things randomly. It also gives an understanding
    of what is possible and when computer systems themselves are
    inadequate.
-   **Further study.** Programming lays the foundation for higher
    study, at A level and beyond. Computation over large data sets is
    becoming pervasive in many subjects, and programming and modelling
    skills are increasingly necessary, rather than merely
    desirable, and applied in a range of school subjects.
-   **The workplace.** Practical computing skills, especially
    programming, are enormously valuable when students later enter the
    world of work. Programming skills equip students for work in the
    tech sector, but are also highly prized across a huge range of other
    professions. This will only increase in the future.
-   **Life.** As learners progress with their lives, they will ever
    more need to be able to both do and
    understand computing in order to be successful citizens.
    Great computational thinking, of value almost everywhere, will come
    from great programming experience.

Programming projects develop teamwork, communication, logical thinking,
and problem solving skills. These are precisely the "soft skills"
that are so highly prized by employers and others. Practical work in
computing offers repeated opportunities to develop, exemplify and
practise these skills.

### Programming informs critical judgement.

The experience of how
hard it is to get a program right, and how subtle bugs can be, may help
students to have more accurate and well-founded critical judgement about
the application of computing. Knowing that the systems they are using
may have bugs, or may be poorly designed and unnecessarily hard to use,
engenders a very different attitude than the blind faith one sometimes
sees, and avoids the common refrain "I can't use computers" when the
problem is that they are unusable. There have been a series of high
profile cases in recent years, exemplified by the post office Horizon
software scandal, where a computer system was blindly trusted over
humans, leading to many innocent sub-postmasters and mistresses being
jailed with thousands of lives ruined. Such scandals would be far less
likely if more people understood how easily programs can be fallible,
and so were more critical in them rather than investing blind
faith.

### Looking to the future. 

In the professional world, computing is
already changing not only how we do science, but what science we
do; not only how we do art, but what art we do; and
similarly in almost all subject disciplines. These profound changes in
subject disciplines will increasingly appear at school level (as they
have already in geography and design and technology, for example), and
success will depend critically on students' digital competence.

## 3. Programming work is essential pedagogy

Programming gives an enormous boost to learning, both of computing
itself, and other aspects besides. Indeed, it is indispensable in
learning the theory of computing, both in terms of better understanding
and getting better grades. Why?

-   **Programming brings theory to life**. While some will love the
    subject for its intellectual beauty alone, academic computer science
    divorced from learning-by-doing can become for many a dry,
    unmotivated subject. The experience of deploying knowledge to solve
    problems illustrates and motivates that knowledge, and also
    consolidates it into a form that is actually retained. Practical
    building work is thus one very strong (if not the only) way to avoid
    the trap of turning an exciting subject into a boring, difficult
    one.
-   **Programming is enormously motivating for some**. Learning is
    hard work, and learning to program can be very hard work, so it is
    incredibly helpful that programming is so
    rewarding. Getting their program to
    work powerfully motivates many students to learn, and gives them a
    sense of ownership and agency through solving a programming
    task they set themselves.
-   **Programming can build confidence**. If they manage to
    develop strategies to solve new and unfamiliar problems, students
    can gain confidence, especially when the initial solutions may not
    work. To gain such benefits universally requires careful
    scaffolding.  
-   **Programming environments offer immediate, non-judgemental feedback.**
    If your program is wrong, it won't work, and the computer
    will tell you so, remorselessly, but non-judgmentally (and for
    certain kinds of mistakes immediately). It will give you the
    opportunity to form a hypothesis about what is wrong, devise
    experiments to verify that hypothesis, leading to understanding the
    cause of the bug and a path to fixing it.
-   **Programming consolidates learning**. When doing practical
    programming work students repeatedly draw on, and give concrete form
    to, knowledge and ideas learned in class. It involves them actively
    processing the material (in semantic wave terms doing unpacking and
    repacking activity themselves, see [Maton, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0898589812000678)). Learning by doing in general,
    and practical work (so programming) in particular, is a vital part
    of this activity. This unpacking/repacking process consolidates
    learning, both through working with concrete examples linking theory
    and practice, repetition and through giving the ideas a practical
    context. It leads to deep rather than shallow understanding.
-   **Programming develops a learner's initiative and creativity**.
    Much of school work is closed-form: learn this knowledge.
    Well-scaffolded practical work can put the student in the driving
    seat, inviting them to create systems or programs that have never
    before existed. Their solutions can be eye-opening.

Although practical programming is not formally assessed outside exams
as a part of the grade for GCSE Computer Science, students who have the
opportunity to engage in well-scaffolded practical work are likely to
get much better grades in written exams than students who do not:

- Firstly, practical programming promotes good learning, as discussed
    earlier, and good learning leads directly to good grades in written
    exams.
-   Secondly, it is an explicit goal of the awarding organisations to design  written exams that are hard to do well in, without extensive experience of programming. This is much more possible in computing than it is to do the equivalent in (say) natural science. For example, if a question asks a student to predict what a particular code fragment will do, they are much more likely to succeed if they have had plenty of experience of reading and writing code themselves. 
   
We are not arguing that computing should be taught only, or even
primarily, through practical programming work. Theory is important as
well as practice. Deep conceptual understanding underpins practical
skills as well as vice versa. Program comprehension is important as
well as program development. A balance is essential.

Nor are we arguing that all practical work in computing should take the
form of programming: computing can also be enriched by many other forms
of practical work across all areas, such as unplugged activities,
physical computing, debates, competitions, digital media, and the
like. Rather, we have chosen to address programming specifically in
this paper, both for its singular importance, and to maintain a sharp
focus.

## 4. What good practical work looks like

Practical programming should be an engaging, motivating and authentic
experience. For example, in addition to core tasks concerned with
learning the basics:

-   Pupils can engage in tasks that they find personally
    relevant, perhaps basing these on their interests outside of
    school or on topics from other subjects they are studying.
-   They can collaborate with one another or with others,
    including adult mentors both within and outside the school. 
-   They can do independent research using the web, incorporate
    others' code or ideas into their own programs and get advice or
    feedback from external mentors. 
-   They can develop programs or systems to solve real-world
    problems relevant to others in their communities. They may
    even in doing so form the foundations of a start-up company or
    career.
-   They can share their work with a wide audience, both to
    others in the school, but also to a global audience, so gaining
    prestige and confidence.
-   They can develop their knowledge of a particular programming
    language beyond the narrow scope of an exam specification.
-   For those who have already achieved competence in a first
    programming language, they can go on to develop knowledge of
    multiple programming languages and paradigms, so deepening and
    generalising their understanding of constructs.

A rich experience of practical programming takes time, and requires
support from teachers and school leaders. However, freed from the
requirement for controlled conditions, project work can now be done in
the pupil's own time, perhaps as a regular homework task or as open
ended tasks during school holidays. It can also be done just for fun as
a hobby at home or in clubs in ways that contribute directly in terms of
skills and knowledge to the ultimate assessments.

### 4.1 What is "practical programming"?

[Programming, or coding, is often thought of as \"starting from a blank
sheet of paper, write a program to do this task\". Â But actually there
is a much richer space of practical work in programming, including

-   **Simply experimenting with the medium.** Programming
    environments like Scratch make it easy to try things out in a
    playful, exploratory way: "I wonder what happens if I press that
    button/drag that shape?". At this stage the goal is to experiment,
    gain confidence that nothing bad will happen, and to gain intuition
    about what happens. 
-   **Run a program, and work out what causes it to do what it
    does.** A good way to start learning is to teach yourself. Have
    pupils take small programs you provide and run them, see what they
    do and then try to work out what line causes certain effects to
    happen. For example, when you run the program, it prints
    `HelloÂ World`. Which specific line actually causes that to happen?
    Why print that rather than something else? Another program asks for
    the pupil's name, then greets them by name. Which line made it stop
    and wait for them to type something in. How did what they typed then
    end up being printed in the greeting? What causes a monster to
    appear? What makes it a red monster? This is a good precursor to
    making changes ...
-   **Copy an existing program, run it, and then start making
    small changes to it.** The program solves the
    "blank sheet of paper" problem.  Some changes are limited but fun
    (e.g. change the colour of the monster). As confidence builds,
    pupils will become more ambitious (e.g. can we have more than one
    monster?).
-   **Predict what a program does**. Â One important aspect
    of computational thinking is to be able to predict what a program
    will do.  For simple, straight-line programs (i.e a simple sequence
    of instructions) this is pretty easy; the more complicated the
    program, the harder it gets.  But at every level the ability to
    reason logically about the program is key. After making the
    prediction run it to see if you were right. If you were then it
    confirms in part your understanding. More importantly, if not, then
    this tells you something important about things you do not
    understand, such as identifying misconceptions about the way
    concepts work. As with science it is when predictions are wrong that
    most is learnt!
-   **Predict what a change will do**. Â A variation of the
    above is to predict what effect a change to the program will
    have. This needs to be founded on a good understanding of what it
    does originally. Uncaught bugs often arise from changes where the
    consequences were not understood by the programmer (for example [much
    of the US telephone network crashed in 1990](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517013-200-technology-sorry-no-numbers-the-day-the-uss-telephone-network-crashed/) with 75 million calls
    unanswered because of a change made to 6 lines of code out of
    millions to improve it). Thinking up small changes and predicting
    what they will do is a powerful way for pupils to
    actively experiment with their understanding of new
    concepts.
-   **Test a program thoroughly to check it is working
    properly**. Take a program and ensure it always works. Programs
    often appear to work when run but bugs are hidden waiting to be
    triggered when certain things are input. Creating and following a
    test plan (e.g. ensuring all branches are tested, checking what
    happens with extreme values or unexpected values is a skill in
    itself).
-   **Debug a program that is not working properly.** For
    example, if you want to draw a square with a floor turtle, you might
    forget to put the pen down, so the turtle crawls around but doesn't
    draw anything. Debugging always involves coming up with a guess (or
    hypothesis) about what is going wrong, performing experiments to
    confirm the guess, and making a change that you predict will fix
    it.
-   **Explain to someone else how/why your program
    works**. The simple act of explaining your program often
    reveals latent bugs in it, potential simplifications to your code,
    and reveals misconceptions or misunderstandings. It also deepens
    understanding of concepts. A variation of this (part of '*pair
    programming*') is to write a program in pairs, with one person (the
    'driver') at any time doing the typing with the other (the
    'navigator') deciding and explaining what to write and why. The
    navigator must convince the driver that what they are suggesting is
    both sensible and correct. This gives the driver the chance to point
    out issues and ask for better explanations where things are unclear.
    Requiring the navigator to do this helps both gain a deeper
    understanding and improve their skills.
-   **Read a program and figure out its purpose**. For
    example  
`[T := 0; for I = 1..N { T := T+I }]`  
You could talk about loops and variables, but an experienced programmer
would say "oh, that just adds up the numbers between `1` and `N`, and puts
the total in `T`".  That is, she has worked out the *purpose* of
the code, rather than just following the individual steps it
takes.

-   **Starting from an idea of what you want your program to do,
    write a program from scratch to do it.**
    This involves specification, design, abstraction, implementation,
    testing, and debugging.
-   **Iteratively develop a large program: modify a large program to do
    more.** This involves repeatedly understanding the existing
    program and making changes. It may involve adding new functionality
    so you extend what it does while ensuring the old behaviour still
    works correctly. It could involve modifying that existing behaviour
    to do some more complex and useful variation (eg so that it does the
    same thing faster). This is also the basis of iterative
    development - a key and critical way to develop large programs,
    where a series of versions are created that each are ensured to work
    before moving to the next. In this case it may be the programmers
    own work that is being developed. It is an important programming
    skill to develop in its own right.

### 4.2 Reviewing your provision for practical programming

In reviewing your approach to practical programming, at every key
stage, the following questions may be useful. Different things may work
for different schools; there are no silver bullets!

#### Responding to the individual learner

How are you adapting programming work to the needs and interests of
individual pupils?

-   Do pupils have a choice over the context for practical work?
-   Does practical work allow some opportunities for creative
    expression?  
-   How are you, or teachers in your department, helping pupils who
    would otherwise struggle?
-   What support is in place to allow students to work at their own
    pace, repeatedly building solid foundations before moving on to
    concepts that build on them?
-   How are you/ your teachers challenging pupils who would otherwise
    find typical projects trivial?
-   What support is offered for those with special educational needs
    and disability (SEN/D)?

#### Working with others

-   Does your practical work involve teamwork? Â 
-   Do stronger students have the opportunity (and the incentive) to
    help weaker ones? Is their support constructive to learning (eg
    teaching to debug) rather than destructive (eg giving code answers
    or taking over the keyboard)?
-   Can pupils explain (to you and to others) what they've done, and
    how they did it? Are they documenting their code so that others
    could read and understand it?
-   Are you making use of mentors from local employers /
    universities?
-   Is there an audience for pupils' work?

#### Process

-   Is the practical work well scaffolded? Are you offering guidance
    about what to do, in what order, to help your pupils past the "blank
    sheet of paper" problem? Â Are they using standard algorithms, design
    patterns and development approaches?
-   Are students working in a way so they do not overreach themselves,
    so that they master individual concepts in practice before moving on
    to incorporating more complex concepts in their work. Are they
    creating complex artefacts that they have little hope of getting to
    work, before doing any work to see if they do? If they are, how are
    you ensuring they step back and take smaller steps?
-   Do you have a timely way to identify and fix basic misconceptions
    that act as a barrier to progress?
-   What happens when pupils' programs don't work? Have they been
    provided with a good understanding of different kinds of errors, and
    strategies for testing and debugging their code from the outset? Do
    they show perseverance when faced with challenges? How do you deal
    with learned helplessness?
-   Do you offer in-flight formative feedback to your students about
    their practical work, to help them over obstacles?
-   Are pupils thinking about the design of their program, how to solve
    problems or develop their projects before they start programming?
-   How can pupils tell if they have succeeded with their practical
    work? What feedback will they receive? Who will provide this? Is
    such feedback available only at the end or in stages
    throughout?
-   Are there opportunities for pupils to learn new programming ideas
    independently? How do you avoid their developing misconceptions if
    they do? How do you ensure they do not use code or techniques found
    on the Internet that they do not understand?
-   How do you support pupils to manage their time in an extended
    project? Are you using any approaches from software engineering,
    such as iterative development or sprints?
-   Is practical programming helping pupils to acquire fluency in a
    particular programming language and a particular paradigm?

## 5. Going deeper

If you want more ideas to dip into, for how to turn a general intention
to offer rich practical work into a practical reality, there are many
resources to help. Here are some suggestions, many written by or
contributed to by the authors of this white paper, and upon which much
of the argument here is based.

### Tips and principles available on the web

The questions in Section 4 may feel daunting, depending on your
experience, in teaching. However, there is lots of advice in the form of
more detailed tips and principles with respect to answering these
questions both specifically and in general. Here are some places to
start, whatever your level of experience.

-   [How we teach
    computing](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/how-we-teach-computing)
    a set of twelve principles for teaching computing from the UK
    National Centre for Computing Education (NCCE). Points range from
    the importance of program comprehension to the need for students to
    do unpacking and repacking activity. Most are backed up with quick
    read sheets that go into the points made in much more detail, but in
    a very practical way.
-   [Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify and Make
    (PRIMM)](https://raspberrypi-education.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Quick%2BReads/Pedagogy%2BQuick%2BRead%2B11%2B-%2BPRIMM.pdf).
    This NCCE quick read is a short overview of a popular approach to
    structuring lessons in programming, backed by research. The separate
    steps represent different stages of one or more lessons. It promotes
    discussion about how programs work, and encourages reading of code
    before writing, so combines several of the suggestions outlined
    above.
-   [Teaching London Computing's "Learning to Learn to
    Program\"](https://teachinglondoncomputing.org/learning-to-learn-to-program).
    These web pages provide practical tips for both teachers and
    students over what matters most when learning (so teaching)
    programming. Advice ranges from the importance of believing your
    students can get better to the importance of setting up a learning
    environment with quick and frequent feedback, all with specific
    practical tips.
-   [CS Teaching
    Tips](https://www.csteachingtips.org).
    Â The goal of this project, led by Colleen Lewis was Â to document and
    disseminate effective computer science teaching practices. Â They
    offer 1300+ \"tips\", many backed with videos, and categorised by
    topic, such as Scratch, or classroom management.
-   [Miles Berry\'s 14 principles of practical
    programming](http://milesberry.net/2021/11/practical-programming).
    Focussed on upper secondary projects. This includes suggestions
    ranging from how to approach debugging positively to the importance
    of explanations.
-   [Ten quick tips for teaching practical
    programming,](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id%3D10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006023) Brown
    & Wilson 2018. Research from educational psychology suggests that
    teaching and learning are subject-specific activities: learning
    programming has a different set of challenges and techniques than
    learning physics or learning to read and write. Computing is a
    younger discipline than mathematics, physics, or biology, and while
    there have been correspondingly fewer studies of how best to teach
    it, there is a growing body of evidence about what works and what
    doesn\'t. This paper presents 10 quick tips that should be the
    foundation of any teaching of programming, whether formal or
    informal.
-   [Why we should teach our children to
    code](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/issues/10),
    Peyton Jones, Hello World Oct 2019 (page 62ff). This article was a
    direct response to Andreas Schleicher (Director of Education at
    OECD)\'s question \"[Should schools teach coding?](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2019/02/21/teaching-children-coding-waste-time-oecd-chief-says/)\".

### Books

There are also a range of recent books that explore how practically to
teach computing including programming that give much more detailed
advice, when you are ready, and have the time, to explore how to teach
programming, and computing more generally, in more depth.

-   [Computer Science in K12: An A to Z handbook on teaching
    programming](https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/about),
    edited by Suchi Grover, Edfinity, 2020. This is a practical guide
    focussing on teaching introductory programming effectively based on
    research (and written by leading researchers). It covers a wide
    variety of approaches to teaching through practical work.
-   [Computer science education: a perspective on teaching and learning
    in
    school](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/computer-science-education-9781350057111),
    edited by Sue Sentance, Bloomsbury Academic, 2021. Â This has a
    broader focus than Grover\'s book, but very much based on research,
    with chapters written by experts and also with a practical
    focus.
-   [100 ideas for secondary teachers: outstanding computing
    lessons](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/100-ideas-for-secondary-teachers-outstanding-computing-lessons-9781472984401),
    Simon Johnson, Bloomsbury Education, 2021. This is again wider than
    just programming though focusses on very practical classroom
    approaches - lots of ideas of what an outstanding lesson looks
    like.
-   [Creating the Coding Generation in Primary Schools: A Practical
    Guide for Cross-Curricular
    Teachin](https://www.routledge.com/Creating-the-Coding-Generation-in-Primary-Schools-A-Practical-Guide-for/Humble/p/book/9781138681194),
    Steve Humble, Routledge, 2017
-   [Hacking the Curriculum: Creative Computing and the Power of
    Play](https://www.johncattbookshop.com/hacking-the-curriculum-creative-computing-and-the-power-of-play), Ian
    Livingstone and Shahneila Saeed. John Catt Educational, 2017.
    Â Whilst not specifically about programming this argues for the
    importance of play-based learning with a strong emphasis on
    creativity. It focuses on more general computing practical activity,
    but the Â overarching ideas certainly apply to teaching programming
    too.]{.c8 .c22}
-   [Code-It: How To Teach Primary Programming Using
    Scratch](http://code-it.co.uk/scratchbook),
    Phil Bagge, University of Buckingham Press, 2015. This focuses
    specifically on teaching programming in Key Stage 2, with
    classroom-tested approaches. It gradually introduces important
    concepts and techniques through a wide variety of different
    programming projects.
-   [Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful
    Ideas](http://worrydream.com/refs/Papert%2520-%2520Mindstorms%25201st%2520ed.pdf),
    Seymour Papert, New York: Basic Books, 1980. The classic text on
    teaching programming in elementary and middle school, using Logo.
    Papert makes a strong argument for learning through making, with
    programming being a tool to think with, rather than the end goal.
    
-   [Learner-centred design of computing education: research on
    computing for
    everyone](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00684ED1V01Y201511HCI033),
    Mark Guzdial, Morgan and Claypool, 2015. Students have different
    reasons for wanting to learn to program; Guzdial's book takes this
    as a starting point to explore what different approaches might be
    appropriate for the different goals that students have in mind.
    
-   [Lifelong Kindergarten: cultivating creativity through projects,
    passion, peers and
    play](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/lifelong-kindergarten),
    Mitch Resnick, MIT Press, 2018. Scratch's creator argues for a more
    creative approach to computing education, in which learners' own
    projects form the focus.
-   [How to Raise a Tech
    Genius](https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/shahneila-saeed-2/how-to-raise-a-tech-genius/9781472143624),
    Shahneila Saeed, 2020. This has a broad focus and is primarily aimed
    at parents learning Computer Science alongside their children.
    However, the breadth of practical unplugged activities can provide
    some good ideas for engaging classroom activities; with several
    chapters being devoted specifically to algorithmic thinking and
    logical reasoning.

There are many more books and resources available on teaching
programming, with more being published all the time, so consider these
as places to start.
