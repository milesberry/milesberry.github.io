Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the world, and education is no exception. Do we see AI as the friendly and helpful Baymax from Big Hero 6, supporting our teaching and learning needs? Or is it more like the Terminator, an unstoppable force that threatens to take over? The truth lies somewhere in between.

### The State of AI Policy in Education

Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate AI while harnessing its potential. HMG has outlined five core regulatory principles for AI in public sector organisations throughout the UK: safety, security, transparency, fairness, and accountability. These principles provide a solid foundation for schools looking to integrate AI while ensuring ethical governance.

[Ofsted](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsteds-approach-to-ai/ofsteds-approach-to-artificial-intelligence-ai), ever watchful, will expect that schools will have clear policies in place, ensuring responsible and transparent AI integration. This is not about rushing to use AI in every classroom but about understanding its implications and establishing guidelines that align with public sector regulations.

### AI’s Role in Reducing Teacher Workload

One of the most immediate benefits of AI in education is its potential to reduce teacher workload. England's DfE has funded pilot projects aimed at using AI for lesson planning, activity adaptation, and feedback generation. Some of these tools, such as [Aila](https://labs.thenational.academy/), are proving particularly useful in lesson planning. Similarly, the proof of concept work we've seen on automated feedback is not replacing teachers but augmenting their abilities, freeing up time for more personalised instruction.

The recent [DfE policy update](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education) reflects this shift. While initial discussions about AI in education suggested teaching students how to use AI, the current stance is more teacher-centric. The emphasis is now on using AI to create educational resources, assist with lesson planning, and provide tailored feedback. There is now more caution when it comes to student use, particularly for younger learners, due to concerns about safety, data privacy, and intellectual property rights.

### AI Literacy: A Future Curriculum Priority?

While teachers are currently the primary beneficiaries of AI in education, there is growing recognition that students need AI literacy skills. [The AI Opportunity Action Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan/ai-opportunities-action-plan) includes the need for AI education, particularly at post-16 levels. The UK's approach is still in flux, but there are indications that AI will become a more formal part of the school curriculum. Countries like South Korea have already embedded AI and digital literacy into their national education strategies, providing a model that the UK government is closely examining.

The European Union has taken a more structured regulatory approach. [The EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), some of which came into effect on 2nd February, mandates training for individuals using AI tools in organisations. This requirement ensures that those employing AI technologies understand how they work and the ethical considerations involved. While the UK does not have a comparable law, the Government Digital Service has developed an [AI playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html) with practical guidance, including ten key principles for AI use in the public sector.

### The Future of Teaching: Evolution or Revolution?

For centuries, the core model of school education has remained relatively unchanged. A teacher stands before a group of students, imparting knowledge. While technology has altered aspects of this model—interactive whiteboards replacing chalk, group seating replacing rows—the fundamental structure endures. Some, including [the Secretary of State for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/education-secretary-gives-bett-show-2025-keynote-address), think that with AI, we may be on the cusp of a more radical transformation.

Will AI-powered personalised learning platforms replace traditional classrooms? Probably not, at least not anytime soon. But the potential for AI to support individualised learning pathways, automate administrative tasks, and provide intelligent feedback is undeniable. The challenge lies in balancing innovation with thoughtful implementation, ensuring that AI enhances, rather than disrupts, the educational experience.

### Ethical and Practical Considerations

As AI becomes more integrated into education, ethical considerations must remain at the forefront. Issues of bias, data privacy, and the potential for over-reliance on AI tools must be carefully managed. Educators have a responsibility to teach students not only how to use AI effectively but also how to use it responsibly. Critical thinking, ethical awareness, and digital literacy are essential skills in this AI-driven world.

For schools, compliance with AI regulations is crucial. Most AI tools have age restrictions—typically 13 and above—raising questions about their use with younger students. Schools must also ensure that AI applications comply with intellectual property laws and data protection policies.

### Moving Forward with AI in Education

AI is neither a magic solution nor an existential threat. It is a tool—one that, when used wisely, can transform education for the better. Policymakers must continue refining guidelines to balance innovation with safety. Schools must establish clear policies and provide training for staff to use AI effectively. Most importantly, educators must equip students with the skills to navigate this evolving digital landscape.
