Well not exactly&#8230; The Hollywood film crew were back to film a few more scenes for The Holiday, but alas the stars were not in attendance. We did, though, manage to get a little closer to the action, so close in fact that both of our coats ended up covered in fake snow.

Rumour has it that the scene in which Cameron Diaz gets out of the mini and answers her phone needed 23 takes.
