Long, but interesting and well-balanced [piece in Friday&#8217;s Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/nov/18/techno-toddlers-a-for-apple) about apps for pre-schoolers which may be of interest to many of you &#8211; there are connections here with some of the conversations we&#8217;ve had at Roehampton about interactivity in PGCE and Y2 lectures.

One of the contributors makes an interesting distinction between toys and games, although &#8220;The concept of a computer toy is something many children and their carers still have to learn to get their heads around.&#8221;

John Siraj-Blatchford is quoted: &#8220;A child&#8217;s computer time could be solitary, sedentary and of little educational value. Or it could be educationally rich, involving a group of children, for example, interacting together at the computer and encouraging off-screen activities&#8230;&#8221; This, of course, is as true inside school as outside.
