Last Friday&#8217;s coverage of Moodle in the Times Educational Supplement&#8217;s Online section has now hit the web archive.

There are pieces by Jack Kenny about [our use at St Ives](http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2206513), about [the lack of involvement of schools in the decision making process](http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2206514), and another on [a similar theme](http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2206498). There&#8217;s also a piece by Dorothy Walker about [the terminology](http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2206511).
  
Leon Cych&#8217;s TES blog last week also explored the

[Learning Services Framework Agreement](http://www.tes.co.uk/blogs/blog.aspx?path=/ICT/&post=2202353), and he had a piece in Web Extras about the [failure to fund school based initiatives](http://www.tes.co.uk/2202023).
