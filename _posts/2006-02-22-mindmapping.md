A good IT lesson this morning, using [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) open source mind mapping software. I&#8217;ve tended to be relatively cynical about mind-mapping in the past, as I tend to work in outline lists myself, but having been reading a number of things about visual communication recently I thought we&#8217;d give it a go.<!--more-->

We&#8217;re just starting on an extended research and presentation task, linked to their History work on the 2nd World War, but I wanted a little more planning to go in this time round, about how to structure the slides, what sort of information they&#8217;d need to find out and so on. FreeMind seemed ideally suited for the purpose, and they coped far better with the hover rather than click interface than I did! This is the one we produced together as we brain-stormed (or is thought-showered these days?) ideas for topics:

</p>

It was really interesting to watch them sorting headings into child/sibling nodes, and in a few cases moving these round to fit better with their topic as their research progressed. For those who stuggled to get started, being able to move from a website to copy/paste headings into the map also seemed fairly effective at encouraging them to read webpages for key points.

I think it&#8217;s also likely to be a good way of them organizing the actual research side of things too, rather than typing straight onto the slides.
