Wow.
  
Many thanks for all the work that&#8217;s gone into getting the new release up and running.
  
I spotted the download was available first thing this morning, and took the plunge to upgrade from v0.2 [here](http://stiveshaslemere.com).

<!--more-->It took about 90 minutes to get things working right &#8211; the two main problems were:

  * MySQL didn&#8217;t like the first two lines of update.sql, rewriting as
  
    > DELETE FROM templates WHERE 1>0;
  
    > DELETE FROM template_elements WHERE 1>0;
    
    seemed to do the trick.</li> 
    
      * v 0.3 is _not_ happy sitting in a webserver subdirectory. The rewritebase in .htaccess needs changing, and to get things working I&#8217;ve had to put another .htaccess in the webserver root, with manual rewrites for each of my users&#8217; profiles. Aargh. If there&#8217;s some simple way to get round this, please say!</ul> 
    
    That said, all this was sorted in time for the lesson &#8211; more posts focussing mainly on yesterday&#8217;s drama workshop, together with great fun creating avatars from the creative commons collection at [Stortroopers.com](http://www.stortroopers.com/). Interestingly, one or two of my pupils miss the old style grey and purple interface, especially the pencil star icon. Now they can see who&#8217;s who, they&#8217;re rapidly creating lists of friends.
