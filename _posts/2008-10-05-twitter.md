Well, I know I&#8217;m really late coming to this particular party, but for the last week I&#8217;ve been spending time with [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mberry "Twitter"), a micro-blogging, social networking tool. There&#8217;s a really vibrant ed-tech community there, which it&#8217;s pretty easy to link up with by just following the people followed by others (if you see what I mean), with a wonderfully rapid exchange of ideas: there&#8217;s been much over the last week that I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed or thought of without this twittering. It&#8217;s also a great way of staying in touch with friends that I&#8217;ve been far too out of touch with of late. It&#8217;s still early days for me at this, but it&#8217;s been interesting exploring a few of the interfaces: I like [twitterific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific "twitterific"), both on the desktop and the iphone, although the web interface isn&#8217;t bad either. Also on the iphone, I have locly &#8211; which, as well as finding nearby flickr images, wikipedia articles, restaurants and the like, also displays geo-tagged tweets.

I&#8217;d love to try twitter at a conference. It would be really interesting to see this working in class or out on a school trip too; although I suspect a walled garden version would be a good idea for this.
