Nice coverage in today&#8217;s Guardian for Terry Freedman and my upcoming seminar at BETT

[George Cole writes](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2006/dec/12/elearning.technology25):

> One of the BCS-supported seminars is called Social Technologies and Learning in Your Classroom (Thursday January 11, Room A at 3.15pm) presented by BCS members Miles Berry and Terry Freedman. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking at the Web 2.0 technologies, such as blogs, podcasts and wikis, and how they can be used as a vehicle for learning,&#8221; says Berry. &#8220;We&#8217;ll also cover social networking, using Flickr photo-sharing software and e-portfolios.&#8221; The presentation will also include case studies taken from Freedman&#8217;s book, Coming of Age, an electronic version of which is available free at [www.terry-freedman.org.uk.](http://www.terry-freedman.org.uk./)

There&#8217;s also a mention in J[ohn Davitt&#8217;s piece](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2006/dec/12/elearning.technology9):

> Elsewhere, use of opensource software in many schools suggests some form of digital altruism is at work: people are performing wonders at the chalkface but also documenting and sharing their experiences for free (often through online blogs) so that others can follow.
> 
> &#8220;Opensource software, such as Moodle and Elgg, allows a school or local authority to deliver on the e-strategy in a way that&#8217;s suited to the needs of teachers and learners, using programs that they can adapt to their own requirements at minimal cost,&#8221; says Miles Berry, headteacher and digital philanthropist.
> 
> &#8220;These programs are built on a recognition of the unique contributions that teachers and learners can make, rather than delivering pre-packaged &#8216;learning objects&#8217; from the content industry.&#8221;
> 
> At Bett, Berry and ICT adviser Terry Freedman will show how blogs and podcasts can support learning (3pm, Thursday January 11, stand SW60).
