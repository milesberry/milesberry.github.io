Interviewed by Jack Kenny for today&#8217;s Guardian about Moodle:

> And Moodle has also been written by teachers, something Miles Berry [&#8230;] feels is also key. Moodle software &#8220;is written &#8230; by those involved in education and so has evolved with the features education wants it to have. Moodle is not just about online courses but building an online learning community.&#8221;
