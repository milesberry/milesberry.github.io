Those who&#8217;ve been following the recent Open Source Schools [discussion thread](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/freemis-schooltool-need-robust-uk-centric-open-source-mis.html) on open source MIS systems will be pleased to learn of the release of [SchoolTool](http://schooltool.org/) v1.0 after what developer [Tom Hoffman](http://www.tuttlesvc.org/) describes as a long and winding road, stretching back to 2000.

SchoolTool, whose development has been supported by the [Shuttleworth Foundation](http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/), is a web-based, open source, student information system and calendar [server](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/glossary/term/100) designed for primary and secondary schools worldwide. The goal of the project is for a simple, turnkey system. Today&#8217;s version 1 release supports demographics, gradebook, attendance, calendaring (inlcuding timetables and resource booking) and reporting. With a well documented API and modular architecture, it should be possible for other developers to customize SchoolTool to local requirements and add in extra functionality, as well as supporting integration with other web-based tools. There are more details of the feature list at <http://book.schooltool.org/htmlhelp/features.html>

SchoolTool is released under the [GPL](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/glossary/term/75) v2, and is buit in [Python](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/system-tools/lamp/python) on [Zope](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/web-based-applications/zope) 3, with internationalisation already in place via [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/)&#8216;s [Rosetta](https://launchpad.net/rosetta) service. It&#8217;s a three step install on [Ubuntu](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/system-tools/gnulinux/linux/ubuntu) [Linux](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/system-tools/gnulinux/linux).

Tom and his team are commited to continued, brisk development prior to a number of scheduled deployments for the next academic year, and are keen that &#8220;schools, service providers, government agencies, vendors, hackers and other interested parties&#8221; have the chance to test, use, deploy and offer feedback on SchoolTool over the next few months.

There&#8217;s already been some [discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sf-uk-mias/browse_thread/thread/fe146b29b9a8a74b#) on the SchoolForge UK MIAS list.
