A lot of the half term has been spent at the computer (surprise, surprise!), reading more of the blogosphere than I normally get chance to, but also trying out a few other bits of web 2.0 for the first time.<!--more-->

Flickr has been a real inspiration, and it&#8217;s been great to have the excuse to look back over nearly five years of digital photos &#8211; very happy memories of holidays and day-trips.

I&#8217;ve also been reading David Cairn&#8217;s Mozart and his Operas, which is a great mixture of biography and accessible music criticism, placing the great operas in the context of Mozart&#8217;s life, and enriching my grasp of both in the process. Good to listen again to the recordings I have of some, and a great temptation to complete the set. Radio 3&#8217;s broadcast of Covent Garden&#8217;s Marriage of Figaro on Wednesday evening was worth hearing too &#8211; I believe BBC2 will be televising it over the Easter holdiays.

Having missed it at the cinema, we eventually got round to seeing Pride and Prejudice on DVD &#8211; both Nightly and MacFadyen&#8217;s interpretations seemed to own lots to Ehle and Frith in the BBC version, but none the worse for that. I&#8217;m tempted to watch the Beeb one again, to figure out what&#8217;s been missed out from the film. Inspired by this we also took in Sense and Sensibility.

We&#8217;ve actually had Hollywood in Godalming over the week, filming for &#8220;[The Holiday](http://www.hellomagazine.com/travel/2006/02/10/camerondiaz/)&#8220;, bringing fake shops, snow, christmas decorations, and Cameron Diaz to our corner of Surrey. We were quite astounded by the number of people involved, and it looks as though they&#8217;ll be back this week, as they need to do a few more snow scenes.
