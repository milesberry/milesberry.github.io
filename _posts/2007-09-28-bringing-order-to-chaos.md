I have [an article](http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2441105) in today&#8217;s TES Magazine about using Moodle in the Foundation Stage or Key Stage 1:

> &#8230; Key stage 1 teachers particularly value Moodle&#8217;s facility to provide a portal to all the online resources used with a class. They use Moodle to keep together a collection of hotlinks to websites, games, interactive whiteboard files, audio or video clips, worksheets and other resources that their class will use. &#8230;
