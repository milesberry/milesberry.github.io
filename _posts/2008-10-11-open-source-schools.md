It&#8217;s nice to see [opensourceschools.org.uk](http://opensourceschools.org.uk/ "opensourceschools.org.uk") up and running. This is an information portal for schools, developed by alphaplus consultancy &#8220;on behalf of Becta&#8221; &#8211; some readers may remember [the mild furor](http://oss.itproportal.com/articles/2008/06/17/bectas-open-source-contract-alpha-plus-outrages-other-bidders/ "the mild furor") that surrounded a firm with relatively little open source experience, coming from outside the open source community, winning the contract to promote open source software in schools. It could be argued that alphaplus&#8217;s lack of significant prior involvement in open source gives them a degree of objectivity which may well count in their favour. It&#8217;s interesting comparing Becta&#8217;s commercial approach here with the more community based approach favoured by JISC, which happily sponsors open source development and funds the excellent [OSS-Watch](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/ "OSS-Watch"), but this is a start, and it&#8217;s great to see Becta doing more, at last, to promote open source as a viable alternative to commercial software, after quite a period when there&#8217;s been a perception of bias against open source, perhaps particularly in regard to the learning platform rollout.

It&#8217;s early days for alphaplus&#8217;s site, but it&#8217;s a fairly polished effort already, making good use of Drupal (which we use ourselves for the school website) for content management. There&#8217;s [an interesting write-up](http://www.opensourceschools.org.uk/perins-school-case-study.html "an interesting write-up") of the extensive use of Moodle being made by our neighbours [Perins,](http://www.perins.net/ "Perins,") where all Year 7s (including a few of my former pupils) are issued with laptops: laptop+VLE being greater than the sum of the parts. In fact, there&#8217;s already quite a collection of interesting case studies of schools using open source software to a greater or lesser degree, and the tagging system that Drupal provides makes it easy enough to track down those that seem most relevant. There are also a few interesting articles: [Getting started with open source software](http://www.opensourceschools.org.uk/node/138 "Getting started with open source software") is a good place to start, with a five low risk, high gain ways to use open source: fix a problem or meet a need, do something cool with desktop applications, set up a thin client cafe (this is a really nice idea in terms of the informal and independent learning possibilities it would open up), use open source software on servers (how I got started two schools ago), and install web applications.

There&#8217;s not much activity in the forums as yet, but here&#8217;s hoping the site will grow into an important resource for UK schools and local authorities interested in exploring open source.
