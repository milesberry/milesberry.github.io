*The Curriculum and Assessment Review [final report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6908f7a3c0dc8f12484175e5/Curriculum_and_Assessment_Review_final_report_-_Building_a_world-class_curriculum_for_all.pdf) was published today. It recommends that the DfE "Replaces GCSE Computer Science with a Computing GCSE which reflects the full breadth of the Computing curriculum and supports students to develop the digital skills they need." This is something that we've long campaigned for, see [here](/2024/10/gcse-computing/), and [here](/2019/06/gcse-computing/). Here are our initial thoughts on what such a GCSE should cover*  

## Subject aims and learning outcomes  

GCSE specifications in computing must build on the knowledge, understanding and skills established through the programme of study for computing at key stage 3, satisfy requirements at  key stage 4 and enable students to progress into further learning and/or employment. They must address knowledge and skills across computer science, information technology and digital literacy.  

GCSE specifications in computing should enable students to:  

* understand and apply the fundamental principles and concepts of computer science, including abstraction, decomposition, logic, algorithms, and data representation.  
* analyse problems in computational terms through practical experience of solving such problems, including designing, writing, testing and refining programs.  
* develop their capability, creativity and knowledge in computer science, digital media and information technology  
* think computationally, creatively, innovatively, analytically and critically.  
* evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar
technologies, to solve problems  
* be ethical, competent, confident and creative users of information and
communication technology.  
* understand the impacts of digital technology for the individual and for wider society.  
* understand how changes in technology affect safety and security, including protecting online privacy and identity.  

## Knowledge and Understanding  

GCSE specifications in computing must require students to develop the knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of computer science as set out below and the ability to apply this knowledge and understanding.  

### Algorithms, data and programming  
 
* Following, understanding, and designing algorithms to solve problems 
* Key programming concepts, including:  
* describing programs in terms of inputs, processes and outputs  
* variables and other data structures  
* sequence  
* selection (conditionals), including Boolean operators  
* iteration, both with finite (count controlled) and with conditional termination  
* the use of subroutines including ones with parameters and how they support modularity and abstraction  

### Key data type concepts in computers, including:  
  
* the concept of data type, including integer, Boolean, real, string, and data structures including lists (or arrays)  
* the representation of numbers, text, sound, and graphics  

### The principles on which AI systems are built and issues associated with these systems:  

* training data  
* common machine learning algorithms (in general terms, without details of implementation)
the applications of the above to large language models  
* issues of bias and hallucination

### Information systems and their application
  
* Structured data  
* tables  
* file hierarchies  
* Storing, managing and retrieving data  
* Protecting information (including access, backup and archiving)  
* The benefits and risks of collaborative tools  
* Legal aspects: data protection, computer misuse, IP including creative commons

### The World Wide Web
  
* The internet as a network of networks  
* The technologies that underpin the Web: URLs, HTML, HTTP  
* How search engines select and rank results  
* The importance of accessible design  
* Common applications of the web (such as social media and e-commerce)  
* Develop web pages using HTML and CSS  

### Broader impacts of computing  
  
* Cyber security, including:  
* forms of attack (based on technical weaknesses and behaviour)  
* ways to protect software systems (during design, creation, testing and use)  
* The broader impacts that digital technology can have on individuals, wider society, culture, the economy and the environment, including issues of ethics, legality, bias.  
* The impact of digital devices and online services on: self-image and identity, the management of online information, relationships, health, well-being and lifestyle, reputation, privacy and security, bullying, intellectual property.  
* Their rights, responsibilities and opportunities online, including that the same expectations of behaviour apply in all contexts, including online.  
* How information and data are automatically collected and used online.  
* How advertising and information is targeted at them and how to be a discerning consumer of information online

## Skills  
  
* Managing projects - collect user needs, decompose a problem, develop a solution, evaluate solution against requirements  
* Programming - solve a problem / create a simulation  
* Work effectively with data - clean, analyse and present data  
* Manipulate text, audio and visual assets across a range of digital media and for a range of purposes  
* Use online services including collaboration platforms, search engines and AI systems critically, effectively and efficiently  
* Create and present information using advanced features of a word processor, spreadsheets, graphics software and presentation software  

## Assessment

### 50% practical exam
  
* 3 hours long at set exam time  
* Students should complete hands-on tasks that demonstrate their ability to apply learned skills in practical settings, including coding, software use, and digital content development.  
* Covers programming, media and data
Pre-release materials either solving a problem or creating something to meet user needs; also prior access to the dataset and media assets.  
* No access to internet during the exam  
* Design and develop a solution - e.g. modify a given program to implement a new feature; create a 30s video to promote a cause using provided assets; analyse a provided dataset and present findings.

### 50% exam
  
* Covering the above skills and knowledge,  
* Written questions assessing knowledge of CS principles, IT concepts, and DL practices.  
* Scenario-based questions that require students to analyse situations and propose solutions.  
* Ethical considerations related to technology use and its societal impacts.

## Short course content

The above, with a focus on a 60 minute practical exam on digital media  and a single hour paper exam. Potentially one practical exam.
