Today I rounded off our Year 6 unit on Victorian Mathematics (which I meant to do last half term, when it was still their history topic, but you know how it is&#8230;), with a very quick tour of some bits of the history of computing and calculation. I have my father&#8217;s old 7 figure log tables, slide rule and first Sinclair calculator, which makes it that bit more personal.<!--more-->

One really great thing is how easy all the education-technology makes it to teach such anachronistic topics as slide rules: being able to demonstrate one on the big board via a visualizer is so much easier than holding up our yard long wooden demonstration slide rule that I found in the maths store. And of course there&#8217;s a [virtual slide rule](http://www.taswegian.com/SRTP/JavaSlide/javaslide.html) on the net for them to practise with.

Once I&#8217;d told them that log 10 was 1, and log 100 was 2, most of them got the idea, and a good number worked out log 0.1. Having convinced the class of the rules for multiplication, division, powers and roots, one bright spark asked &#8220;So what about things that don&#8217;t end in zeros?&#8221;, and so we had a go at using some log tables.

Another then wanted to know how they could work out the tables. I explained that they used computers, which was met with some scepticism. The notion that people used to be called computers struk them as really strange, but here&#8217;s the OED:

> Computer: One who computes; a calculator, reckoner; spec. a person employed to make calculations in an observatory, in surveying, etc.

It then occured to them that this wasn&#8217;t a particularly reliable approach, which led us beautifully on to the story of Babbage and his Engines.

We had a look at some of the stuff from the [Science Museum site](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp), and they weren&#8217;t at all surprised to learn that the first programmer was a woman. Alas, I&#8217;ve not found a virtual Analytical Engine to show off, but I&#8217;ve put a link onto Moodle to a [virtual Curta](http://www.vcalc.net/curta_simulator_en.htm), so they can get something of a feel for mechanical calculators.

Homework&#8217;s a wiki based resarch task on and around Babbage. Coincidentaly, I spotted a piece in today&#8217;s TES about a calculator exhibition at Swindon&#8217;s [Museum of Computing](http://www.museum-of-computing.org.uk/). School trip? Perhaps not.

Throughout the lesson, I had Dale Jone&#8217;s [Pythonesque post](http://www.helpusgettobett.com/?p=65) in the the back of my mind.
