I have [a piece in today&#8217;s TES Magazine](http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6003675) exploring the use that teachers and school leaders could make of personal information management tools like calendars, contacts and to-do lists:

> Apart from your markbook, what other tools do you use daily or weekly to stay organised and on top of things? I bet many of the things we need as teachers are pretty much the same as those for people working with clients and projects outside of education. The computerised Personal Information Management (PIM) tools they use as a matter of routine can make our lives easier too.
