I, alas, missed out on Latin in my school days, but feel that a Basic grounding in programming was almost as good at teaching something of linguistic structures, and the creativity-within-constraints that&#8217;s been important for lots of real world problem solving.

These days, it&#8217;s all too likely that young people will miss out on both, as some deem them too difficult or irrelevant for inclusion in the curriculum. A shame this, and whilst I&#8217;d acknowledge that they might not suit everyone, surely personalised learning should include challenges for the brightest and best. Furthermore, I can&#8217;t help feeling that by not providing today&#8217;s pupils with the opportunities to write code that the BBC Micro generation had, we&#8217;re limiting their (and thus our) chances to compete in a global knowledge economy (yes, I&#8217;m reading [The World is Flat](http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/worldisflat.htm) at the moment, qv [Friedman&#8217;s videoed lecture at MIT](http://mitworld.mit.edu/play/264/)).

There&#8217;s been an interesting set of discussions on the HMC ICT list recenly about teaching programming, and what are the best languages to use with lower secondary pupils. [Logo](http://www.softronix.com/logo.html) is great for primary aged pupils, and [Papert](http://www.papert.org/)&#8216;s work seems just as relevant today as it did when Mindstorms was written back in 1980. That said, there must be a place for teaching proper programming too, as such a rich environment for authentic, problem-based learning. The favoured options seem to be:

  * VBA, as a way of extending Excel work, and probably relevant for coursework projects for those continuing on to A-levels in computing
  * Java, for object orientation, and because it&#8217;s a grown-up real world language, although there was concern that the learning curve was a bit too steep
  * Python, as it teaches good habits, can integrate with lots of other tools very easily, and has some well designed [IDEs](http://www.die-offenbachs.de/detlev/eric3.html); I&#8217;ve heard python recommended highly as a good first programming language by other folks too; and
  * PHP, as pupils can do really useful stuff without too steep a learning curve, and there are loads of FLOSS projects that they can start contributing to. That said,Â  word has it that PHP is just a bit too easy, and so isn&#8217;t as likely to encourage good programming habits as some of the others.

I&#8217;d be interested to hear what folks think about the relative merits of these, or other possibilities. For computer club this term, I&#8217;ve taken up [Dale Jones&#8217;](http://dale.ethink.org.uk/) suggestion of [Alice](http://alice.org/), which is a highly visual, open source, object oriented &#8216;language&#8217;/IDE, and looks great for writing animations and simple games. We&#8217;re still working through the excellent online tutorials, but I hope to be able to share some of this work here in due course.

Back to the Latin: although it&#8217;s not on the curriculum here, we&#8217;ve had an optional after-school club for Larin, and I can recommend the excellent online materials from the [Cambridge Latin Course](http://www.cambridgescp.com/page.php?p=clc%5Eoa_intro%5Eintro). They&#8217;re well presented, and so well structured that they can almost be used by pupils independently, without much need for teacher input, although I think they&#8217;d be much more effective as support for a classroom based course. I&#8217;ve also just discovered that there&#8217;s a Latin &#8220;[vicipaedia](http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)&#8220;, which would be a great thing for a few school classics departments to adopt. Anyone fancy writing a latin [language pack](http://download.moodle.org/lang/) for Moodle?
