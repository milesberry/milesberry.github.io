# ITT Early Career Framework — Lesson Feedback Knowledge Base

**Primary framework:** ITT Early Career Framework (DfE, 2024)  
**Supplementary frameworks:** Rosenshine's Principles of Instruction (2012) · IES Practice Guide: Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student Learning (Pashler et al., 2007) · Ofsted State-funded School Inspection Toolkit (updated September 2025)

**Note on Ofsted content:** The toolkit is primarily a leadership and inspection management document. The Ofsted annotations in this knowledge base draw exclusively from sections with direct classroom-level relevance: the "Teaching" evidence-gathering criteria (pp.21–22), the "Inclusive curriculum and teaching" criteria (p.22), and the "Behaviour, including bullying" and "Attitudes to learning" criteria (pp.38–39). Sections on safeguarding, governance, parental engagement, attendance management and CPD systems are not included as they are not observable in a single lesson. Where toolkit language is quoted or paraphrased, the relevant page reference is given.

The ITTECF provides the organising structure and maps directly to the Teachers' Standards. Rosenshine and IES annotations identify convergent evidence for observable classroom behaviours. Where multiple frameworks converge on the same behaviour, this should be noted explicitly in feedback as it carries greater evidential weight. **TS8 (Professionalism) is largely not observable in a single lesson and should be omitted from automated feedback** except where TA deployment is directly evidenced.

## TS1 — High Expectations

*Set high expectations which inspire, motivate and challenge pupils.*

### Learn That
- **1.1** Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.
- **1.2** Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.
- **1.3** Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils from their starting points is essential.
- **1.4** Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture.
- **1.5** A culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships.
- **1.6** High-quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils' life chances, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
- **1.7** High quality teaching is underpinned by positive interactions between pupils, their teachers and their peers.
- **1.8** Pupils' experiences of school and their readiness to learn can be impacted by their home life and circumstances, particularly for EAL pupils, young carers, and those living in poverty.

### Learn How To

**Communicate a belief in the academic potential of all pupils by:**
- **1a** Using intentional and consistent language that promotes challenge and aspiration.
- **1b** Setting tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a challenging curriculum.
- **1c** Creating a positive environment where making mistakes and learning from them and the need for effort and perseverance are part of the daily routine.
- **1d** Seeking opportunities to engage parents and carers in the education of their children.

**Demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations by:**
- **1e** Creating a culture of inclusion, respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed.
- **1f** Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations (e.g. for contributions, volume level and concentration).
- **1g** Applying rules, sanctions and rewards consistently in line with school policy.
- **1h** Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made.

### Supplementary Framework Alignment
- **Rosenshine P1** (Daily review): Beginning a lesson with review sets an expectation of effort and academic engagement. Supports 1.3.
- **Rosenshine P10** (Engaged practice): High success rates during practice reinforce pupils' belief in their own potential. Supports 1.3, 7.4.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Teachers' expectations should not be too low, either for all pupils or for particular groups. The toolkit flags low teacher expectations as grounds for an "urgent improvement" grade, making this directly observable in the classroom. Inspectors look for language and task design that communicate belief in pupils' capacity to succeed.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Inclusive curriculum and teaching, p.22)**: Adaptations for specific pupils should focus on long-term success rather than short-term fixes; leaders and inspectors consider the possible downsides of any adaptations. Teachers should not use differentiation as a mechanism for lowering expectations of particular pupils.

### Observable Indicators
- Teacher uses language that signals belief in all pupils' capacity to succeed (e.g. "when you can do this" rather than "if you manage to").
- Tasks are pitched to stretch without overwhelming; the teacher adjusts in response to pupil performance.
- Effort and progress are acknowledged explicitly, not just correct answers.
- Mistakes are treated as learning opportunities rather than failures.
- Behavioural expectations are stated clearly and applied consistently.

## TS2 — Promote Good Progress

*Be accountable for pupils' attainment, progress and outcomes.*

### Learn That
- **2.1** Learning involves a lasting change in pupils' capabilities or understanding.
- **2.2** Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.
- **2.3** An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.
- **2.4** Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded.
- **2.5** Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.
- **2.6** Pupils have different working memory capacities; some pupils with SEND may have more limited working memory capacity.
- **2.7** Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly.
- **2.8** Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.
- **2.9** Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall.
- **2.10** Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn.

### Learn How To

**Avoid overloading working memory by:**
- **2a** Taking into account pupils' prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce.
- **2b** Breaking complex material into smaller steps (e.g. using partially completed examples to focus pupils on specific steps).
- **2c** Reducing distractions that take attention away from what is being taught.

**Build on pupils' prior knowledge by:**
- **2d** Identifying possible misconceptions and planning how to prevent these forming.
- **2e** Linking what pupils already know to what is being taught (e.g. explaining how new content builds on what is already known).
- **2f** Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before encountering more complex content.
- **2g** Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed.

**Increase likelihood of material being retained by:**
- **2h** Balancing exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical knowledge and skills.
- **2i** Planning regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time.
- **2j** Designing practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting challenging work.
- **2k** Increasing challenge with practice and retrieval as knowledge becomes more secure (e.g. by removing scaffolding, lengthening spacing or introducing interacting elements).

### Supplementary Framework Alignment
- **Rosenshine P1** (Daily review): Begin lessons with review of previous material to activate prior knowledge and strengthen retention. Directly supports 2.2, 2.9, 2h, 2i.
- **Rosenshine P2** (Small steps): Present new material in small steps with practice after each. Directly supports 2.4, 2b.
- **Rosenshine P6** (Guided practice): Students need extensive practice to develop fluency; teacher checks understanding throughout. Supports 2.8, 2j.
- **Rosenshine P9** (Independent practice): After guided practice, students consolidate learning independently with high success rates. Supports 2.8, 2k.
- **IES Rec 1** (Space learning): Distribute practice over time rather than massing it. Directly supports 2.9.
- **IES Rec 2** (Interleave): Mix different problem types during practice to strengthen discrimination. Supports 2k.
- **IES Rec 3** (Retrieval practice): Use quizzes and low-stakes testing to strengthen memory. Directly supports 2.9, 2h.
- **IES Rec 6** (Concrete before abstract): Use concrete examples before abstract representations. Supports 2.7, 2e.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Teachers teach the subject curriculum in a way that allows pupils to transfer key knowledge to long-term memory. Teaching is sequenced so that new knowledge and skills build on what has been taught before. Inspectors look for evidence that teachers prioritise retrieval practice and assessment as tools for embedding knowledge.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — School and subject curriculum, p.21)**: The curriculum builds in time for revisiting content and dealing with gaps in knowledge and skills. Inspectors consider whether the lesson reflects a coherent sequence rather than an isolated episode.

### Observable Indicators
- Lesson opens with review or retrieval activity drawing on prior learning.
- New content is introduced in clearly defined steps; the teacher does not advance until the current step is secure.
- The teacher makes explicit connections between new material and what pupils already know.
- Tasks are designed to produce high success rates whilst still being challenging.
- Scaffolding is present and the teacher signals when or how it will be reduced.
- Pupils are invited to share points of confusion; misconceptions are addressed rather than noted and moved past.

## TS3 — Subject and Curriculum Knowledge

*Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge.*

### Learn That
- **3.1** A school's curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn.
- **3.2** Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively.
- **3.3** Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils' confidence and help them succeed.
- **3.4** Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is an important aspect of curricular knowledge.
- **3.5** Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial.
- **3.6** In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about.
- **3.7** Pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (schemata); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.
- **3.8** Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.

### Learn How To

**Deliver a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum by:**
- **3a** Identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these critical components.
- **3b** Ensuring pupils' thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject.
- **3c** Working with experienced colleagues to accumulate and refine a collection of powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and demonstrations.
- **3d** Using resources and materials aligned with the school curriculum.
- **3e** Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts.

**Support pupils to build increasingly complex mental models by:**
- **3g** Balancing exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge.
- **3h** Revisiting the big ideas of the subject over time and teaching key concepts through a range of examples.
- **3i** Drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject.

**Develop fluency by:**
- **3j** Providing tasks that support pupils to learn key ideas securely (e.g. quizzing pupils).
- **3k** Using retrieval and spaced practice to build automatic recall and application of key knowledge.

**Help pupils apply knowledge and skills to other contexts by:**
- **3l** Ensuring pupils have relevant domain-specific knowledge before being asked to think critically within a subject.
- **3m** Interleaving concrete and abstract examples, slowly withdrawing concrete examples and drawing attention to the underlying structure of problems.

**Develop pupils' literacy by:**
- **3p** Teaching unfamiliar vocabulary explicitly and planning for pupils to be repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary.
- **3s** Teaching, modelling, and requiring high quality oral language (oracy), recognising that spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing.

### Supplementary Framework Alignment
- **Rosenshine P3** (Questions): Ask questions to check for understanding and to identify gaps and misconceptions before moving on. Supports 3.4, 3e.
- **Rosenshine P2** (Small steps with models): Present material with worked examples and step-by-step demonstrations. Supports 3.3, 3g.
- **Rosenshine P8** (Scaffolds): Provide models and worked examples, especially for novice learners. Supports 3.3, 3m.
- **IES Rec 4** (Concrete then abstract): Use concrete examples before introducing abstract representations. Supports 3.7, 3m.
- **IES Rec 5** (Combine graphics and verbal): Pair verbal explanations with diagrams where appropriate. Supports 3.7.
- **IES Rec 6** (Worked examples): Use worked examples to reduce cognitive load when introducing new material. Supports 3.3, 2.10.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Teachers must have expert knowledge of the subjects they teach; where they have gaps, they should be supported. Inspectors evaluate whether teachers present information clearly, focusing on the most important knowledge or concepts. The toolkit flags weak subject knowledge as grounds for urgent improvement.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — School and subject curriculum, p.21)**: The curriculum should have subject-specific rigour so that pupils gain disciplinary knowledge and can answer subject-specific questions. Teachers make explicit the distinctive ways of knowing within their subject.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Teachers identify misunderstandings and adapt teaching as necessary to correct these. Checking for and correcting misconceptions is a specific inspector focus rather than a peripheral concern.

### Observable Indicators
- Teacher demonstrates secure subject knowledge; explanations are accurate and clear.
- Key vocabulary is introduced explicitly and used consistently.
- Teacher anticipates or addresses misconceptions directly rather than waiting for them to surface.
- Lesson content builds on prior knowledge with explicit links made.
- Examples and non-examples are used to develop conceptual understanding.
- Foundational knowledge is established before more complex ideas are introduced.

## TS4 — Classroom Practice

*Plan and teach well-structured lessons.*

### Learn That
- **4.1** Effective teaching can transform pupils' knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning.
- **4.2** Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned.
- **4.3** Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.
- **4.4** Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases.
- **4.5** Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success.
- **4.6** Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils' prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.
- **4.7** High quality classroom talk (oracy) can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.
- **4.8** Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success.
- **4.9** Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.

### Learn How To

**Plan effective lessons by:**
- **4a** Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need more structure early in a domain.
- **4b** Enabling critical thinking and problem solving by first teaching the necessary foundational content knowledge.
- **4c** Removing scaffolding only when pupils are achieving a high degree of success in applying previously taught material.
- **4d** Using evidence of prior learning to provide sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate and practise applying new knowledge and skills.
- **4e** Breaking tasks down into constituent components when first setting up independent practice.

**Make good use of exposition by:**
- **4f** Starting expositions at the point of current pupil understanding.
- **4g** Combining a verbal explanation with a relevant graphical representation of the same concept or process, where appropriate.
- **4h** Using concrete representation of abstract ideas (e.g. making use of analogies, metaphors, manipulatives, examples and non-examples).

**Model effectively by:**
- **4i** Narrating thought processes when modelling to make explicit how experts think (e.g. asking questions aloud that pupils should consider when working independently).
- **4j** Making the steps in a process memorable and ensuring pupils can recall them (e.g. naming them, developing mnemonics, or linking to memorable stories).
- **4k** Exposing potential pitfalls and explaining how to avoid them.

**Stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding by:**
- **4l** Planning activities around what you want pupils to think hard about.
- **4m** Including a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils (e.g. by modelling new vocabulary or asking pupils to justify answers). Elaborate on and query pupil contributions.
- **4n** Providing appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required.
- **4o** Considering the factors that will support effective collaborative or paired work.
- **4p** Providing scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue.

### Supplementary Framework Alignment
- **Rosenshine P2** (Small steps): Present new material in small steps with pupil practice after each step. Directly supports 4.2, 4a, 4e.
- **Rosenshine P3** (Questions): Ask a large number of questions; check responses of all students; rephrase if a student cannot answer. Supports 4.6, 4m.
- **Rosenshine P4** (Think aloud): Model by thinking aloud and narrating processes. Directly supports 4.3, 4i.
- **Rosenshine P5** (Check for understanding): Check for pupil understanding before moving on. Supports 4.6, 4l.
- **Rosenshine P6** (Guided practice): Students need to practise with teacher guidance before working independently. Supports 4.8, 4c.
- **Rosenshine P7** (High success rate): Aim for around 80% success rate during practice. Supports 4.8, 4c.
- **Rosenshine P8** (Scaffolds): Provide temporary supports that are removed as competence grows. Directly supports 4.4, 4c.
- **Rosenshine P9** (Independent practice): Consolidation through independent practice should follow, not replace, guided practice. Supports 4.8.
- **IES Rec 4** (Concrete-abstract): Begin with concrete examples before moving to abstract representations. Supports 4h, 4.3.
- **IES Rec 5** (Combine visual and verbal): Pair explanations with appropriate diagrams; avoid redundant on-screen text that competes with teacher speech. Supports 4g.
- **IES Rec 6** (Worked examples): Use worked examples to model expert thinking, especially with novices. Directly supports 4.3, 4i.
- **IES Rec 7** (Metacognition): Teach pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning. Supports 4.5.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: The school's approach to teaching should be based on an evidence-informed understanding of effective teaching and how pupils learn. Teachers present information clearly, promote appropriate discussion, check pupils' understanding systematically, identify misunderstandings and adapt teaching as necessary to correct these. This cluster of behaviours is a core inspector focus.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Leaders and teachers prioritise feedback, retrieval practice and assessment — these three are explicitly named together as a focus for inspector attention, meaning they should be evident in lessons.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Teaching resources and materials should enable pupils to achieve the aims of the curriculum; they should not add cognitive burden or distract from content.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Inclusive curriculum and teaching, p.22)**: Any additional adults in the classroom should be deployed to enable all pupils to access high-quality teaching from their class teacher and to develop pupils' independence over time — not to act as a substitute for the teacher's own instruction.

### Observable Indicators
- New material is introduced in clear steps; the teacher does not move to the next step until the current one is secure.
- Teacher thinks aloud during modelling, narrating the process rather than simply demonstrating it.
- Questions are distributed across the class rather than directed only at volunteers.
- Wait time is used after questions to allow all pupils to think.
- Scaffolds are present and the teacher signals when they will be withdrawn.
- Guided practice precedes independent practice; pupils are not sent to work alone before sufficient modelling.
- Tasks are designed around what the teacher wants pupils to think hard about.
- Concrete or visual representations are used alongside abstract ones when introducing new concepts.

## TS5 — Adaptive Teaching

*Adapt teaching to respond to the strengths and needs of all pupils.*

### Learn That
- **5.1** Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.
- **5.2** Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.
- **5.3** Seeking to understand pupils' differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.
- **5.4** Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.
- **5.5** Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can support learning, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on attainment, behaviour, engagement and motivation.
- **5.6** There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.
- **5.7** Pupils with SEND are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, parents/carers, and pupils to understand barriers to learning and identify effective strategies is essential.
- **5.8** High quality teaching for all pupils, including those with SEND, is based on strategies which are often already practised by teachers.

### Learn How To

**Develop an understanding of different pupil needs by:**
- **5a** Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down.
- **5b** Making use of formative assessment.
- **5f** Utilising existing opportunities to engage with parents and carers to better understand pupils' individual needs.

**Provide opportunity for all pupils to experience success by:**
- **5g** Adapting lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations.
- **5h** Balancing input of new content with the revisiting of prior learning so that pupils master important concepts.
- **5i** Making effective use of teaching assistants and other adults in the classroom.

**Meet individual needs without creating unnecessary workload by:**
- **5l** Planning to connect new content with pupils' existing knowledge or providing additional pre-teaching if pupils lack critical knowledge.
- **5m** Building in additional practice or removing unnecessary expositions.
- **5n** Reframing questions to provide greater scaffolding or greater stretch.
- **5o** Considering carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils.

**Group pupils effectively by:**
- **5p** Applying high expectations to all groups, and ensuring all pupils have access to a rich curriculum.
- **5q** Intentionally grouping in relation to a specific learning outcome, regularly reviewing those groupings, and avoiding the perception that groups are fixed.

### Supplementary Framework Alignment
- **Rosenshine P5** (Check for understanding): Monitor the whole class during practice; identify pupils who are struggling and provide immediate corrective support. Directly supports 5.1, 5a, 5b.
- **Rosenshine P6** (Guided practice): Circulate during guided practice to identify and address misconceptions before independent work. Supports 5.1, 5o.
- **Rosenshine P7** (High success rates): Ensure tasks are matched to pupil readiness so that most pupils succeed most of the time. Supports 5.4, 5g.
- **IES Rec 1** (Spacing): Provide additional spaced practice for pupils who have not yet secured key knowledge. Supports 5h.
- **IES Rec 3** (Retrieval): Use low-stakes retrieval to identify gaps and inform adaptive decisions. Supports 5b.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Inclusive curriculum and teaching, p.22)**: Staff should know how to identify and remove barriers to achievement through effective curriculum design, formative assessment, and adapting their practice. The toolkit is explicit that the school's approach to inclusion must draw on the best available evidence, including high-quality research.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Inclusive curriculum and teaching, p.22)**: Reasonable adjustments or adaptations should focus on pupils' long-term success rather than short-term fixes. Inspectors consider the possible downsides of adaptations — for instance, adaptations that inadvertently lower expectations or increase dependency.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Inclusive curriculum and teaching, p.22)**: Any additional adults in the classroom should be deployed to enable all pupils to access high-quality teaching from their class teacher and to develop pupils' independence over time. The toolkit explicitly warns against using TAs as a substitute for the teacher's own contact with pupils who need more support.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Adaptations or reasonable adjustments that do not meet pupils' needs, or that reflect low expectations for particular pupils or groups, are specifically cited as grounds for an "urgent improvement" grade.

### Observable Indicators
- Teacher circulates and monitors pupil work during tasks, not just at the end.
- Responses to pupil difficulty are immediate and in-lesson rather than deferred.
- Questions are reframed to scaffold or extend depending on individual pupil responses.
- All pupils are given access to the same core content; differentiation is in support, not in expectation.
- Teaching assistants are directed purposefully; their role is supplementary to, not a substitute for, the teacher's attention.
- Groupings, where used, are understood as flexible rather than fixed.

---

## TS6 — Assessment

*Make accurate and productive use of assessment.*

### Learn That
- **6.1** Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils' understanding and needs.
- **6.2** Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.
- **6.3** Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.
- **6.4** To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.
- **6.5** High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.
- **6.6** Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.
- **6.7** Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload.

### Learn How To

**Avoid common assessment pitfalls by:**
- **6a** Planning formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and thinking ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps).
- **6b** Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments.
- **6d** Using available evidence to accurately identify what is required for individuals to meet their next steps.

**Check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons by:**
- **6e** Using assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions.
- **6f** Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions).
- **6g** Prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding.
- **6h** Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions.

**Provide high quality feedback by:**
- **6i** Focusing on specific actions for pupils and providing time for pupils to respond to feedback.
- **6j** Appreciating that pupils' responses to feedback can vary depending on a range of social factors.
- **6k** Scaffolding self-assessment by sharing model work with pupils, highlighting key details.
- **6l** Thinking carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer- or self-assessment.

**Make feedback manageable and effective by:**
- **6o** Using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after lessons where possible.
- **6r** Prioritising the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather than careless mistakes when marking.

### Supplementary Framework Alignment
- **Rosenshine P3** (Questions): Questioning is a primary in-lesson assessment tool; ask many questions; direct questions to all pupils, not just volunteers. Directly supports 6.1, 6e, 6g.
- **Rosenshine P5** (Check for understanding): Do not move on until pupils understand; use techniques that reveal understanding from all pupils, e.g. mini-whiteboards, cold calling, hinge questions. Directly supports 6.2, 6a, 6f.
- **Rosenshine P6** (Guided practice): Circulate and check work during practice; identify errors before they become embedded. Supports 6.1, 6h.
- **IES Rec 3** (Retrieval practice): Use low-stakes quizzes and retrieval activities as in-lesson formative assessment. Supports 6.1, 6e.
- **IES Rec 6** (Worked examples): Checking that pupils can reproduce worked examples independently is a reliable indicator of secure understanding. Supports 6.3, 6f.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Evidence should inform the school's approach to assessment. Inspectors look for assessment being used to help pupils embed and use knowledge fluently, to check understanding and inform teaching, and to understand different starting points and gaps. All three purposes should be evident.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Teachers check pupils' understanding systematically, identify misunderstandings and adapt teaching as necessary to correct these. The word "systematically" is significant — inspectors are looking for planned, purposeful checking rather than incidental questioning.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — Teaching, p.21)**: Leaders and teachers prioritise feedback, retrieval practice and assessment together. Any gaps in pupils' knowledge or skills should be identified and tackled quickly — within the lesson if possible, not deferred.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Curriculum and teaching — School and subject curriculum, p.21)**: The curriculum should build in time for revisiting content and dealing with gaps — this applies at lesson level as well as curriculum planning level, and inspectors may probe how the teacher responds when gaps surface mid-lesson.

### Observable Indicators
- Assessment is embedded in the lesson, not bolted on at the end.
- The teacher uses techniques that reveal understanding from all pupils, not just those who volunteer (e.g. cold calling, mini-whiteboards, exit tasks, hinge questions).
- Teacher probes correct answers to confirm understanding is secure, not just that the answer was guessed.
- Misconceptions are identified and addressed in the lesson, not simply noted and moved past.
- Feedback given during the lesson is specific and actionable, not merely evaluative.
- The teacher adjusts the lesson in response to assessment evidence rather than proceeding regardless.

## TS7 — Managing Behaviour

*Manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment.*

### Learn That
- **7.1** Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment.
- **7.2** A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils, including younger pupils, but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.
- **7.3** The ability to self-regulate one's emotions affects pupils' ability to learn, success in school and future lives.
- **7.4** Teachers can influence pupils' resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils have the opportunity to experience meaningful success.
- **7.5** Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood.
- **7.6** Pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward).
- **7.7** Pupils' investment in learning is also driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure.
- **7.9** Teaching typically expected behaviours will reduce the need to manage misbehaviour.

### Learn How To

**Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils by:**
- **7a** Establishing a supportive and inclusive environment with a predictable system of reward and sanction in the classroom.
- **7c** Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
- **7d** Checking pupils' understanding of instructions before a task begins.
- **7e** Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
- **7f** Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption.
- **7g** Responding quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens physical or emotional safety.

**Establish effective routines and expectations by:**
- **7h** Creating and explicitly teaching routines in line with the school ethos that maximise time for learning.
- **7j** Reinforcing established school and classroom routines (e.g. by articulating the link between time on task and success).

**Motivate pupils by:**
- **7n** Supporting pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards long-term goals.
- **7p** Helping pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically.

- **Rosenshine P10** (Engaged practice): High engagement during well-structured practice reduces the opportunity for off-task behaviour. Effective lesson structure is itself a behaviour management tool. Supports 7.1, 7.9.
- **Rosenshine P7** (High success rate): Pupils who experience regular success are more motivated and less likely to disengage. Supports 7.4, 7.7.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Attendance and behaviour — Behaviour, p.38)**: Leaders and staff should establish appropriate routines and explicitly teach and model the behaviour they expect from pupils, so that these are well understood. The toolkit notes that this is an area for inspection evidence — the teacher modelling expected behaviour is as important as enforcing it.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Attendance and behaviour — Behaviour, p.38)**: Poor behaviour should be prevented from disrupting lessons or the school's day-to-day life. Low-level disruption that prevents learning is specifically named; inspectors evaluate whether teachers challenge it confidently and consistently.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Attendance and behaviour — Behaviour, p.38)**: Relationships between pupils and staff should show kindness, courtesy, empathy and respect, reflecting a positive culture. This is observable in lesson transcripts through the teacher's register, tone, and manner of addressing pupils.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Attendance and behaviour — Attitudes to learning, p.39)**: Pupils should arrive at lessons punctually and settle quickly; low-level disruption should be anticipated, responded to and dealt with so that it is uncommon. Inspectors consider whether pupils are committed to their learning, motivated and self-confident.
- **Ofsted Toolkit (Attendance and behaviour — Inclusive approaches, p.39)**: Staff should make reasonable adjustments and adaptations when considering pupils' needs and challenges, while maintaining high expectations for what all pupils can achieve.

### Observable Indicators
- Transitions between activities are smooth and managed with clear signals.
- Instructions are given in short, sequenced steps; pupils confirm understanding before beginning.
- Low-level disruption is addressed early and quietly without disrupting the flow of the lesson.
- Consistent language and non-verbal signals are used for routine directions.
- The teacher circulates and maintains a physical presence across the room.
- Responses to behaviour are proportionate, calm and in line with the school's approach.
- Pupils are on task for the majority of lesson time.

## TS8 — Wider Professional Responsibilities

*Fulfil wider professional responsibilities.*

> **Note:** TS8 concerns professional conduct, CPD, collaboration and relationships largely outside the classroom. It is not directly observable in a single lesson transcript and should not form the basis of automated lesson feedback. The one partial exception is TA deployment.

**If a TA is present, note whether:**
- **8j/8k** The TA's role is purposeful and supplementary to the teacher's own interactions with pupils; the teacher does not cede responsibility for lower-attaining pupils to the TA.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

These themes cut across multiple ITTECF standards and represent areas where Rosenshine, IES, and ITTECF most strongly converge. They should receive particular attention in feedback generation.

### 1. Retrieval and Review
**ITTECF refs:** 2.9, 2h, 2i, 3k, 6e  
**Rosenshine:** P1, P9 · **IES:** Rec 1, Rec 3

What to look for: Does the lesson begin with retrieval of prior knowledge? Are pupils required to recall rather than simply recognise? Is prior knowledge activated before new content is introduced?

### 2. Worked Examples and Modelling
**ITTECF refs:** 2.10, 4.3, 4.4, 4a, 4i, 4k  
**Rosenshine:** P4, P8 · **IES:** Rec 6

What to look for: Does the teacher narrate their thinking during modelling, or simply demonstrate? Are worked examples followed by guided practice before independent work? Are common errors and pitfalls explicitly identified?

### 3. Questioning and Checking for Understanding
**ITTECF refs:** 4.6, 4m, 4n, 6.1, 6.2, 6a, 6e, 6f, 6g  
**Rosenshine:** P3, P5 · **IES:** Rec 3

What to look for: Are questions distributed across the class or directed only at volunteers? Does the teacher use techniques that surface understanding from all pupils? Does the teacher probe correct answers? Is appropriate wait time given? Does the teacher adjust based on responses?

### 4. Cognitive Load Management
**ITTECF refs:** 2.3, 2.4, 2a, 2b, 2c, 4.2, 4e  
**Rosenshine:** P2 · **IES:** Rec 5, Rec 6

What to look for: Is new material introduced in manageable steps? Does the teacher avoid presenting too much new information at once? Are visual and verbal explanations aligned rather than competing? Is task complexity kept appropriately low when content is new?

### 5. Scaffolding and Gradual Release
**ITTECF refs:** 4.4, 4c, 4e, 5n, 2k  
**Rosenshine:** P6, P8, P9 · **IES:** Rec 4

What to look for: Is there a clear progression from teacher modelling to guided practice to independent work? Are scaffolds removed as competence grows? Does independent practice follow, rather than replace, guided practice?

### 6. Vocabulary and Oracy
**ITTECF refs:** 3.12, 3p, 3s, 4.7, 4m, 4p  
**Rosenshine:** P3

What to look for: Is subject-specific vocabulary introduced and used consistently? Are pupils required to use technical vocabulary in their responses? Does the teacher model precise language? Are pupils' oral responses developed rather than accepted at face value?

## Feedback Guidance for the Platform

**Tone:** Developmental and specific. Feedback is addressed directly to the trainee. It should identify what was observed, connect it to specific ITTECF references, and suggest a concrete next step. Where a behaviour is supported by multiple frameworks, note this as it represents stronger evidence.

**Suggested structure:**
1. Opening summary: what the lesson was broadly about and its overall phase structure.
2. Strengths: two or three specific things done well, referenced to ITTECF statements.
3. Development areas: two or three specific areas for development, referenced to ITTECF statements with concrete suggestions.
4. Cross-cutting observations: any patterns across the lesson worth highlighting.
5. One priority next step: a single, concrete, manageable thing to work on.

**Avoid:**
- Generic praise not grounded in specific transcript evidence.
- Feedback that cannot be evidenced from audio alone (e.g. claims about body language or display materials unless mentioned in speech).
- Reference to TS8 unless TA deployment is directly evidenced.
- Judgement language such as "good", "outstanding" or "requires improvement" which echoes inspection grading.
- Suggestions to "differentiate by learning style" — this is not supported by evidence (see ITTECF 5.6).
