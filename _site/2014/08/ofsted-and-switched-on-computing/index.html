        <p>At the launch event for the <a href="http://barefootcas.org.uk/">BCS Barefoot Computing</a> project, HMI David Brown, Ofsted’s national lead for computing, gave <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Ofstednews/barefoot-conference-computing-and-e-safety-in-schools-jul-11-14">an excellent presentation</a>, setting out his views on what good and outstanding computing would look like in schools. Whilst we’re not expecting any subject survey visits for the new curriculum, I think this gives a pretty good view of how the more general criteria for section 5 inspections should be interpreted in the context of the new computing curriculum.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.risingstars-uk.com/">Rising Stars</a>‘ Naomi Watson and I have been looking through David’s bullet points to see how well <a href="http://www.switchedoncomputing.co.uk/">Switched on Computing</a> matches up to the job of supporting teachers and schools in meeting these expectations. I hope you’ll agree that we’ve done a pretty good job here.</p>

<h2 id="achievement-in-computing-is-good-or-better-when" style="color: #111111;">
  Achievement in computing is good or better when:
</h2>

<blockquote style="color: #666666;">
  <p>
    pupils demonstrate excellent understanding of important concepts in all three strands of the computing curriculum and are able to make connections within the subject because they have highly developed transferable knowledge, skills and understanding
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p style="color: #4d4d4c;">
  Switched on Computing has full coverage of the new Programme of Study for computing from Years 1–6, ensuring that children develop the knowledge, skills and understanding required throughout the primary years. The links within the subject are highlighted throughout the scheme, with digital literacy elements integrated fully into computer science and IT-based units.
</p>

<blockquote style="color: #666666;">
  <p>
    pupils consistently use their subject knowledge and understanding very effectively in written and verbal explanations and can solve challenging problems
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p style="color: #4d4d4c;">
  Each unit requires children to solve a real-life problem using digital technology. Children are encouraged to apply their knowledge in both verbal and written forms and to produce a tangible outcome. Pupils are expected to present, review or write-up their work in many units.
</p>

<blockquote style="color: #666666;">
  <p>
    pupils make highly effective use of a wide range of hardware and software appropriate to their age and ability
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p style="color: #4d4d4c;">
