### My blog

I started blogging on Elgg, back in 2005 when we introduced this at the primary school I was then working at. I then migrated the blog over to a Wordpress instance I hosted myself, and have now made the move to a static site usign Jekyll, hosted on Github. 

I'm using a modified version of [Cole Townsend](http://github.com/coletownsend/)'s [Balzac theme](http://github.com/coletownsend/balzac-for-jekyll/).

Most of the content is under a Creative Commons by-sa licence, except where stated. The featured images are my own photos, taken on or just before the date of the post. I'm slowly working through the pages checking and updating links...

_Miles._
