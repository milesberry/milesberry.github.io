I&#8217;m Professor of Computing Education at the [University of Roehampton](http://roehampton.ac.uk). 

I run our [secondary PGCE in computer science](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-computing-specialism/), and also teach on our [primary PGCE](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-primary/) and the University's [Digital Media degree](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/undergraduate-courses/digital-media/). I was part of our AI working group and the steering group for our [new computer science degree](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/undergraduate-courses/computer-science/). I ran a combined blogging / e-portfolio platform for ITT students, acted as technical lead for the [Creative Connections](http://creativeconnexions.eu) EU Comenius project and worked on an Erasmus+ project promoting academic integrity. My principal research focus is uptake and achievement in computing qualifications. Other professional interests include the pedagogies of computing education, use of open source software and principles in schools, independent learning and online communities in professional learning.

Over the years I have contributed to a number of computing related projects including: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study">the national curriculum computing programmes of study</a>, <a href="http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/CASPrimaryComputing.pdf">the CAS / Naace guide to the computing curriculum for primary teachers</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/CASMTT">training of CAS Master Teachers</a>, Rising Stars <a href="http://www.switchedoncomputing.co.uk/">Switched on Computing</a>, an <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Microsofteduk/computer-science-in-the-national-curriculum">e-book on computer science</a> for Microsoft Education, <a href="http://barefootcas.org.uk/">Barefoot Computing</a>, <a href="http://www.codeclubpro.org/">Code Club Pro</a>&#8216;s training materials, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/0/computing/">BBC Bitesize</a> primary computing resources, <a href="http://primary.quickstartcomputing.org">QuickStart Computing</a> for the BCS and Microsoft,  <a href="http://youtube.com/computingatschool">CAS TV</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/projectquantum">Project Quantum</a>, a crowd sourced national assessment item bank for computing, [Hello World](http://helloworld.cc), a magazine by and for computing and digital making educators, [the AI4K12 working group](https://github.com/touretzkyds/ai4k12/wiki) and the Royal Society's Mathematics Futures project. I give keynotes and run workshops at CPD events in England and abroad and am or have been a consultant on a number of international curriculum development projects.

I&#8217;m a chartered fellow of the [British Computer Society](http://bcs.org.uk), and serve on the management board of [Computing at School](http://computingatschool.org.uk). I serve on the academic board of England's [National Centre for Computing Education](https://teachcomputing.org). I am the HE representative on the [Independent Schools Council Digital Strategy Group](https://iscdigital.co.uk/). I was the international rep on the [CSTA](http://www.csteachers.org/)&#8216;s board of directors, and served on the [BCS Academy of Computing](http://academy.bcs.org/) board. I&#8217;m also a fellow of the [Chartered College of Teaching](https://chartered.college/) and a senior fellow of the [HEA](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk) and am accredited as a researcher for the ONS.

Until 2009, I was head of Alton Convent Prep. In my former post as deputy head of St Ives School, Haslemere, I pioneered the use of Moodle and Elgg in primary education. My work on implementing Moodle was documented as the dissertation for Leicester University&#8217;s MBA in Educational Management, and won the 2006 Becta ICT in Practice Award for primary teaching. I run every day, although neither particularly far or fast; my other interests include classical music, creative cookery and photography. My wife, Clare, is a primary school teacher and we have one daughter, born December 2010.
