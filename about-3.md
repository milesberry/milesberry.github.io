I&#8217;m Professor of Computing Education at the [University of Roehampton](http://roehampton.ac.uk). 

I run our [secondary PGCE in computer science](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-computing-specialism/), and also lead the wider curriculum module for our [primary PGCE](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-primary/), and teach on the University's [Digital Media degree](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/undergraduate-courses/digital-media/) and its [Masters in Education](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/education/) programme. I am part of our AI working group, act as a disciplinary officer and look after knowledge exchange for the [Centre for Learning, Teaching and Human Development](https://pure.roehampton.ac.uk/portal/en/organisations/centre-for-learning-teaching-and-human-development).

I ran a combined blogging / e-portfolio platform for ITT students, acted as technical lead for the [Creative Connections](http://creativeconnexions.eu) EU Comenius project and worked on an Erasmus+ project promoting academic integrity. I was part of the steering group for our [new computer science degree](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/undergraduate-courses/computer-science/), and our online learning working party. My principal research focus is uptake and achievement in computing qualifications. Other professional interests include the pedagogies of computing education, use of open source software and principles in schools, and generative AI in education.

Over the years I have contributed to a number of computing related projects including: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study">the national curriculum computing programmes of study</a>, the [CAS / Naace](docs/CASPrimaryComputing.pdf), training of CAS Master Teachers, Rising Stars <a href="https://www.risingstars-uk.com/series/switched-on-computing">Switched on Computing</a>, an e-book on computer science</a> for Microsoft Education, <a href="https://www.barefootcomputing.org/">Barefoot Computing</a>, Code Club Pro's training materials, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/subjects/zvnrq6f">BBC Bitesize</a> primary computing resources, [QuickStart Computing](docs/QuickStart_Computing.pdf) for the BCS and Microsoft,  <a href="http://youtube.com/computingatschool">CAS TV</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/projectquantum">Project Quantum</a>, a crowd sourced national assessment item bank for computing, [Hello World](http://helloworld.cc), a magazine by and for computing and digital making educators, [the AI4K12 working group](https://github.com/touretzkyds/ai4k12/wiki) and the Royal Society's [Mathematical Futures](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/mathematical-futures/) project. 

I give keynotes and run workshops at CPD events in England and abroad and am or have been a consultant on a number of international curriculum development projects. If you'd like to explore ways in which I could contribute to your work, please do <a href="mailto:m.berry@roehampton.ac.uk">get in touch</a>.

I&#8217;m a chartered fellow of the [British Computer Society](http://bcs.org.uk), chair the England computing education committee and serve on the schools and colleges committee, the community board and innovation panel of [Computing at School](http://computingatschool.org.uk). I chair the academic board of England's [National Centre for Computing Education](https://teachcomputing.org). I am the HE representative on the [Independent Schools Council Digital Advisory Group](https://www.isc.co.uk/sector-info/isc-digital-advisory-group/). I was the international rep on the [CSTA](http://www.csteachers.org/)&#8216;s board of directors, and served on the [BCS Academy of Computing](http://academy.bcs.org/) board. I&#8217;m also a fellow of the [Chartered College of Teaching](https://chartered.college/), a senior fellow of the [HEA](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk), and I am accredited as a researcher for the ONS.

Until 2009, I was head of Alton Convent Prep. In my former post as deputy head of St Ives School, Haslemere, I pioneered the use of Moodle and Elgg in primary education. My work on implementing Moodle was documented as the [dissertation for Leicester University&#8217;s MBA in Educational Management](docs/MBA.pdf), and won the 2006 Becta ICT in Practice Award for primary teaching. I run every day, although neither particularly far or fast; my other interests include classical music, creative cookery and photography. My wife, Clare, is a school teacher and we have one daughter, born December 2010.
